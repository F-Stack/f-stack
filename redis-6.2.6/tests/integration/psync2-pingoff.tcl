# These tests were added together with the meaningful offset implementation
# in redis 6.0.0, which was later abandoned in 6.0.4, they used to test that
# servers are able to PSYNC with replicas even if the replication stream has
# PINGs at the end which present in one sever and missing on another.
# We keep these tests just because they reproduce edge cases in the replication
# logic in hope they'll be able to spot some problem in the future.
