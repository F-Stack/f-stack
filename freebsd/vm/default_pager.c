 * fact that no pages of a default object can be swapped out.  The
 * most important optimization is in vm_fault(), where the pager is
 * never asked for a non-resident page.  Instead, a freshly allocated
 * zeroed page is used.
 *
 * On the first request to page out a page from a default object, the
