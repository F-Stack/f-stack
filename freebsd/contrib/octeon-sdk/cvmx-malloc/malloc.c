/*
  This is a version (aka ptmalloc2) of malloc/free/realloc written by
  Doug Lea and adapted to multiple threads/arenas by Wolfram Gloger.

* Version ptmalloc2-20011215
  $Id: malloc.c 30481 2007-12-05 21:46:59Z rfranz $
  based on:
  VERSION 2.7.1pre1 Sat May 12 07:41:21 2001  Doug Lea  (dl at gee)

   Note: There may be an updated version of this malloc obtainable at
           http://www.malloc.de/malloc/ptmalloc2.tar.gz
         Check before installing!

* Quickstart

  In order to compile this implementation, a Makefile is provided with
  the ptmalloc2 distribution, which has pre-defined targets for some
  popular systems (e.g. "make posix" for Posix threads).  All that is
  typically required with regard to compiler flags is the selection of
  the thread package via defining one out of USE_PTHREADS, USE_THR or
  USE_SPROC.  Check the thread-m.h file for what effects this has.
  Many/most systems will additionally require USE_TSD_DATA_HACK to be
  defined, so this is the default for "make posix".

* Why use this malloc?

  This is not the fastest, most space-conserving, most portable, or
  most tunable malloc ever written. However it is among the fastest
  while also being among the most space-conserving, portable and tunable.
  Consistent balance across these factors results in a good general-purpose
  allocator for malloc-intensive programs.

  The main properties of the algorithms are:
  * For large (>= 512 bytes) requests, it is a pure best-fit allocator,
    with ties normally decided via FIFO (i.e. least recently used).
  * For small (<= 64 bytes by default) requests, it is a caching
    allocator, that maintains pools of quickly recycled chunks.
  * In between, and for combinations of large and small requests, it does
    the best it can trying to meet both goals at once.
  * For very large requests (>= 128KB by default), it relies on system
    memory mapping facilities, if supported.

  For a longer but slightly out of date high-level description, see
     http://gee.cs.oswego.edu/dl/html/malloc.html

  You may already by default be using a C library containing a malloc
  that is  based on some version of this malloc (for example in
  linux). You might still want to use the one in this file in order to
  customize settings or to avoid overheads associated with library
  versions.

* Contents, described in more detail in "description of public routines" below.

  Standard (ANSI/SVID/...)  functions:
    malloc(size_t n);
    calloc(size_t n_elements, size_t element_size);
    free(Void_t* p);
    realloc(Void_t* p, size_t n);
    memalign(size_t alignment, size_t n);
    valloc(size_t n);
    mallinfo()
    mallopt(int parameter_number, int parameter_value)

  Additional functions:
    independent_calloc(size_t n_elements, size_t size, Void_t* chunks[]);
    independent_comalloc(size_t n_elements, size_t sizes[], Void_t* chunks[]);
    pvalloc(size_t n);
    cfree(Void_t* p);
    malloc_trim(size_t pad);
    malloc_usable_size(Void_t* p);
    malloc_stats();

* Vital statistics:

  Supported pointer representation:       4 or 8 bytes
  Supported size_t  representation:       4 or 8 bytes
       Note that size_t is allowed to be 4 bytes even if pointers are 8.
       You can adjust this by defining INTERNAL_SIZE_T

  Alignment:                              2 * sizeof(size_t) (default)
       (i.e., 8 byte alignment with 4byte size_t). This suffices for
       nearly all current machines and C compilers. However, you can
       define MALLOC_ALIGNMENT to be wider than this if necessary.

  Minimum overhead per allocated chunk:   4 or 8 bytes
       Each malloced chunk has a hidden word of overhead holding size
       and status information.

  Minimum allocated size: 4-byte ptrs:  16 bytes    (including 4 overhead)
                          8-byte ptrs:  24/32 bytes (including, 4/8 overhead)

       When a chunk is freed, 12 (for 4byte ptrs) or 20 (for 8 byte
       ptrs but 4 byte size) or 24 (for 8/8) additional bytes are
       needed; 4 (8) for a trailing size field and 8 (16) bytes for
       free list pointers. Thus, the minimum allocatable size is
       16/24/32 bytes.

       Even a request for zero bytes (i.e., malloc(0)) returns a
       pointer to something of the minimum allocatable size.

       The maximum overhead wastage (i.e., number of extra bytes
       allocated than were requested in malloc) is less than or equal
       to the minimum size, except for requests >= mmap_threshold that
       are serviced via mmap(), where the worst case wastage is 2 *
       sizeof(size_t) bytes plus the remainder from a system page (the
       minimal mmap unit); typically 4096 or 8192 bytes.

  Maximum allocated size:  4-byte size_t: 2^32 minus about two pages
                           8-byte size_t: 2^64 minus about two pages

       It is assumed that (possibly signed) size_t values suffice to
       represent chunk sizes. `Possibly signed' is due to the fact
       that `size_t' may be defined on a system as either a signed or
       an unsigned type. The ISO C standard says that it must be
       unsigned, but a few systems are known not to adhere to this.
       Additionally, even when size_t is unsigned, sbrk (which is by
       default used to obtain memory from system) accepts signed
       arguments, and may not be able to handle size_t-wide arguments
       with negative sign bit.  Generally, values that would
       appear as negative after accounting for overhead and alignment
       are supported only via mmap(), which does not have this
       limitation.

       Requests for sizes outside the allowed range will perform an optional
       failure action and then return null. (Requests may also
       also fail because a system is out of memory.)

  Thread-safety: thread-safe unless NO_THREADS is defined

  Compliance: I believe it is compliant with the 1997 Single Unix Specification
       (See http://www.opennc.org). Also SVID/XPG, ANSI C, and probably
       others as well.

* Synopsis of compile-time options:

    People have reported using previous versions of this malloc on all
    versions of Unix, sometimes by tweaking some of the defines
    below. It has been tested most extensively on Solaris and
    Linux. It is also reported to work on WIN32 platforms.
    People also report using it in stand-alone embedded systems.

    The implementation is in straight, hand-tuned ANSI C.  It is not
    at all modular. (Sorry!)  It uses a lot of macros.  To be at all
    usable, this code should be compiled using an optimizing compiler
    (for example gcc -O3) that can simplify expressions and control
    paths. (FAQ: some macros import variables as arguments rather than
    declare locals because people reported that some debuggers
    otherwise get confused.)

    OPTION                     DEFAULT VALUE

    Compilation Environment options:

    __STD_C                    derived from C compiler defines
    WIN32                      NOT defined
    HAVE_MEMCPY                defined

    MMAP_CLEARS                1
    HAVE_MREMAP                0 unless linux defined
    USE_ARENAS                 the same as HAVE_MMAP
    malloc_getpagesize         derived from system #includes, or 4096 if not
    HAVE_USR_INCLUDE_MALLOC_H  NOT defined

    Changing default word sizes:

    INTERNAL_SIZE_T            size_t
    MALLOC_ALIGNMENT           2 * sizeof(INTERNAL_SIZE_T)

    Configuration and functionality options:

    USE_DL_PREFIX              NOT defined
    USE_PUBLIC_MALLOC_WRAPPERS NOT defined
    USE_MALLOC_LOCK            NOT defined

    MORECORE_FAILURE           -1
    MORECORE_CONTIGUOUS        1
    MORECORE_CANNOT_TRIM       NOT defined
    MORECORE_CLEARS            1
    MMAP_AS_MORECORE_SIZE      (1024 * 1024)

    Tuning options that are also dynamically changeable via mallopt:

    DEFAULT_MXFAST             64
    DEFAULT_TRIM_THRESHOLD     128 * 1024
    DEFAULT_TOP_PAD            0
    DEFAULT_MMAP_THRESHOLD     128 * 1024
    DEFAULT_MMAP_MAX           65536

    There are several other #defined constants and macros that you
    probably don't want to touch unless you are extending or adapting malloc.  */

  Debugging:

  Because freed chunks may be overwritten with bookkeeping fields, this
  malloc will often die when freed memory is overwritten by user
  programs.  This can be very effective (albeit in an annoying way)
  in helping track down dangling pointers.

  If you compile with -DMALLOC_DEBUG, a number of assertion checks are
  enabled that will catch more memory errors. You probably won't be
  able to make much sense of the actual assertion errors, but they
  should help you locate incorrectly overwritten memory.  The checking
  is fairly extensive, and will slow down execution
  noticeably. Calling malloc_stats or mallinfo with MALLOC_DEBUG set
  will attempt to check every non-mmapped allocated and free chunk in
  the course of computing the summmaries. (By nature, mmapped regions
  cannot be checked very much automatically.)

  Setting MALLOC_DEBUG may also be helpful if you are trying to modify
  this code. The assertions in the check routines spell out in more
  detail the assumptions and invariants underlying the algorithms.

  Setting MALLOC_DEBUG does NOT provide an automated mechanism for
  checking that all accesses to malloced memory stay within their
  bounds. However, there are several add-ons and adaptations of this
  or other mallocs available that do this.

/*
  INTERNAL_SIZE_T is the word-size used for internal bookkeeping
  of chunk sizes.

  The default version is the same as size_t.

  While not strictly necessary, it is best to define this as an
  unsigned type, even if size_t is a signed type. This may avoid some
  artificial size limitations on some systems.

  On a 64-bit machine, you may be able to reduce malloc overhead by
  defining INTERNAL_SIZE_T to be a 32 bit `unsigned int' at the
  expense of not being able to handle more than 2^32 of malloced
  space. If this limitation is acceptable, you are encouraged to set
  this unless you are on a platform requiring 16byte alignments. In
  this case the alignment requirements turn out to negate any
  potential advantages of decreasing size_t word size.

  Implementors: Beware of the possible combinations of:
     - INTERNAL_SIZE_T might be signed or unsigned, might be 32 or 64 bits,
       and might be the same width as int or as long
     - size_t might have different width and signedness as INTERNAL_SIZE_T
     - int and long might be 32 or 64 bits, and might be the same width
  To deal with this, most comparisons and difference computations
  among INTERNAL_SIZE_Ts should cast them to unsigned long, being
  aware of the fact that casting an unsigned int to a wider long does
  not sign-extend. (This also makes checking for negative numbers
  awkward.) Some of these casts result in harmless compiler warnings
  on some systems.

  independent_calloc(size_t n_elements, size_t element_size, Void_t* chunks[]);

  independent_calloc is similar to calloc, but instead of returning a
  single cleared space, it returns an array of pointers to n_elements
  independent elements that can hold contents of size elem_size, each
  of which starts out cleared, and can be independently freed,
  realloc'ed etc. The elements are guaranteed to be adjacently
  allocated (this is not guaranteed to occur with multiple callocs or
  mallocs), which may also improve cache locality in some
  applications.

  The "chunks" argument is optional (i.e., may be null, which is
  probably the most typical usage). If it is null, the returned array
  is itself dynamically allocated and should also be freed when it is
  no longer needed. Otherwise, the chunks array must be of at least
  n_elements in length. It is filled in with the pointers to the
  chunks.

  In either case, independent_calloc returns this pointer array, or
  null if the allocation failed.  If n_elements is zero and "chunks"
  is null, it returns a chunk representing an array with zero elements
  (which should be freed if not wanted).

  Each element must be individually freed when it is no longer
  needed. If you'd like to instead be able to free all at once, you
  should instead use regular calloc and assign pointers into this
  space to represent elements.  (In this case though, you cannot
  independently free elements.)

  independent_calloc simplifies and speeds up implementations of many
  kinds of pools.  It may also be useful when constructing large data
  structures that initially have a fixed number of fixed-sized nodes,
  but the number is not known at compile time, and some of the nodes
  may later need to be freed. For example:

  struct Node { int item; struct Node* next; };

  struct Node* build_list() {
    struct Node** pool;

    if (n <= 0) return 0;

  independent_comalloc(size_t n_elements, size_t sizes[], Void_t* chunks[]);

  independent_comalloc allocates, all at once, a set of n_elements
  chunks with sizes indicated in the "sizes" array.    It returns
  an array of pointers to these elements, each of which can be
  independently freed, realloc'ed etc. The elements are guaranteed to
  be adjacently allocated (this is not guaranteed to occur with
  multiple callocs or mallocs), which may also improve cache locality
  in some applications.

  The "chunks" argument is optional (i.e., may be null). If it is null
  the returned array is itself dynamically allocated and should also
  be freed when it is no longer needed. Otherwise, the chunks array
  must be of at least n_elements in length. It is filled in with the

  In either case, independent_comalloc returns this pointer array, or
  null if the allocation failed.  If n_elements is zero and chunks is
  null, it returns a chunk representing an array with zero elements
  (which should be freed if not wanted).

  Each element must be individually freed when it is no longer
  needed. If you'd like to instead be able to free all at once, you
  should instead use a single regular malloc, and assign pointers at
  particular offsets in the aggregate space. (In this case though, you
  cannot independently free elements.)

  independent_comallac differs from independent_calloc in that each
  element may have a different size, and also that it does not
  automatically clear elements.

  independent_comalloc can be used to speed up allocation in cases
  where several structs or objects must always be allocated at the
  same time.  For example:

  struct Head { ... }
  struct Foot { ... }

  void send_message(char* msg) {
    int msglen = strlen(msg);
    size_t sizes[3] = { sizeof(struct Head), msglen, sizeof(struct Foot) };
    void* chunks[3];
    if (independent_comalloc(3, sizes, chunks) == 0)
      die();
    struct Head* head = (struct Head*)(chunks[0]);
    char*        body = (char*)(chunks[1]);
    struct Foot* foot = (struct Foot*)(chunks[2]);
    // ...
  }

  In general though, independent_comalloc is worth using only for
  larger values of n_elements. For small values, you probably won't
  detect enough difference from series of malloc calls to bother.

  Overuse of independent_comalloc can increase overall memory usage,
  since it cannot reuse existing noncontiguous small chunks that
  might be available for some of the elements.

  enables future requests for chunks of the same size to be handled

  overall memory footprint of a program.

  This malloc manages fastbins very conservatively yet still

  is 80. You wouldn't want it any higher than this anyway.  Fastbins

  M_TRIM_THRESHOLD is the maximum amount of unused top-most memory
  to keep before releasing via malloc_trim in free().

  Automatic trimming is mainly useful in long-lived programs.
  Because trimming via sbrk can be slow on some systems, and can
  sometimes be wasteful (in cases where programs immediately
  afterward allocate more large chunks) the value should be high
  enough so that your overall system performance would improve by
  releasing this much memory.

  The trim threshold and the mmap control parameters (see below)
  can be traded off with one another. Trimming and mmapping are
  two different ways of releasing unused memory back to the
  system. Between these two, it is often possible to keep
  system-level demands of a long-lived program down to a bare
  minimum. For example, in one test suite of sessions measuring
  the XF86 X server on Linux, using a trim threshold of 128K and a
  mmap threshold of 192K led to near-minimal long term resource
  consumption.

  If you are using this malloc in a long-lived program, it should
  pay to experiment with these values.  As a rough guide, you
  might set to a value close to the average size of a process
  (program) running on your system.  Releasing this much memory
  would allow such a process to run in memory.  Generally, it's
  worth it to tune for trimming rather tham memory mapping when a
  program undergoes phases where several large chunks are
  allocated and released in ways that can reuse each other's
  storage, perhaps mixed with phases where there are no such
  chunks at all.  And in well-behaved long-lived programs,
  controlling release of large blocks via trimming versus mapping
  is usually faster.

  However, in most programs, these parameters serve mainly as
  protection against the system-level effects of carrying around
  massive amounts of unneeded memory. Since frequent calls to
  sbrk, mmap, and munmap otherwise degrade performance, the default
  parameters are set to relatively high values that serve only as
  safeguards.

  The trim value It must be greater than page size to have any useful
  effect.  To disable trimming completely, you can set to
  (unsigned long)(-1)

  Trim settings interact with fastbin (MXFAST) settings: Unless
  TRIM_FASTBINS is defined, automatic trimming never takes place upon
  freeing a chunk with size less than or equal to MXFAST. Trimming is
  instead delayed until subsequent freeing of larger chunks. However,
  you can still force an attempted trim by calling malloc_trim.

  Also, trimming is not generally possible in cases where
  the main arena is obtained via mmap.

  Note that the trick some people use of mallocing a huge space and
  then freeing it at program startup, in an attempt to reserve system
  memory, doesn't have the intended effect under automatic trimming,
  since that memory will immediately be returned to the system.

  M_TOP_PAD is the amount of extra `padding' space to allocate or

  * When sbrk is called to extend the top of the arena to satisfy

  request.

  * When malloc_trim is called automatically from free(),
  it is used as the `pad' argument.

  In both cases, the actual amount of padding is rounded
  so that the end of the arena is always a system page boundary.

  The main reason for using padding is to avoid calling sbrk so
  often. Having even a small pad greatly reduces the likelihood
  that nearly every malloc request during program start-up (or
  after trimming) will invoke sbrk, which needlessly wastes
  time.

  Automatic rounding-up to page-size units is normally sufficient
  to avoid measurable overhead, so the default is 0.  However, in
  systems where sbrk is relatively slow, it can pay to increase
  this value, at the expense of carrying around more memory than

  M_MMAP_THRESHOLD is the request size threshold for using mmap()
  to service a request. Requests of at least this size that cannot
  be allocated using already-existing space will be serviced via mmap.
  (If enough normal freed space already exists it is used instead.)

  Using mmap segregates relatively large chunks of memory so that
  they can be individually obtained and released from the host
  system. A request serviced through mmap is never reused by any
  other request (at least not directly; the system may just so
  happen to remap successive requests to the same locations).

  Segregating space in this way has the benefits that:

   1. Mmapped space can ALWAYS be individually released back
      to the system, which helps keep the system level memory
      demands of a long-lived program low.
   2. Mapped memory can never become `locked' between
      other chunks, as can happen with normally allocated chunks, which
      means that even trimming via malloc_trim would not release them.
   3. On some systems with "holes" in address spaces, mmap can obtain
      memory that sbrk cannot.

  However, it has the disadvantages that:

   1. The space cannot be reclaimed, consolidated, and then
      used to service later requests, as happens with normal chunks.
   2. It can lead to more wastage because of mmap page alignment
      requirements
   3. It causes malloc performance to be more dependent on host
      system memory management support routines which may vary in
      implementation quality and may impose arbitrary
      limitations. Generally, servicing a request via normal
      malloc steps is faster than going through a system's mmap.

  The advantages of mmap nearly always outweigh disadvantages for
  "large" chunks, but the value of "large" varies across systems.  The
  default is an empirically derived value that works well in most
  systems.

   malloc_chunk details:

    (The following includes lightly edited explanations by Colin Plumb.)

    Chunks of memory are maintained using a `boundary tag' method as
    described in e.g., Knuth or Standish.  (See the paper by Paul
    Wilson ftp://ftp.cs.utexas.edu/pub/garbage/allocsrv.ps for a
    survey of such techniques.)  Sizes of free chunks are stored both
    in the front of each chunk and at the end.  This makes
    consolidating fragmented chunks into bigger chunks very fast.  The
    size fields also hold bits representing whether chunks are free or
    in use.

    An allocated chunk looks like this:


    chunk-> +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
            |             Size of previous chunk, if allocated            | |
            +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
            |             Size of chunk, in bytes                         |P|
      mem-> +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
            |             User data starts here...                          .
            .                                                               .
            .             (malloc_usable_space() bytes)                     .
            .                                                               |
nextchunk-> +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
            |             Size of chunk                                     |
            +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


    Where "chunk" is the front of the chunk for the purpose of most of
    the malloc code, but "mem" is the pointer that is returned to the
    user.  "Nextchunk" is the beginning of the next contiguous chunk.

    Chunks always begin on even word boundries, so the mem portion
    (which is returned to the user) is also on an even word boundary, and
    thus at least double-word aligned.

    Free chunks are stored in circular doubly-linked lists, and look like this:

    chunk-> +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
            |             Size of previous chunk                            |
            +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    `head:' |             Size of chunk, in bytes                         |P|
      mem-> +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
            |             Forward pointer to next chunk in list             |
            +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
            |             Back pointer to previous chunk in list            |
            +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
            |             Unused space (may be 0 bytes long)                .
            .                                                               .
            .                                                               |
nextchunk-> +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    `foot:' |             Size of chunk, in bytes                           |
            +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

    The P (PREV_INUSE) bit, stored in the unused low-order bit of the
    chunk size (which is always a multiple of two words), is an in-use
    bit for the *previous* chunk.  If that bit is *clear*, then the
    word before the current chunk size contains the previous chunk
    size, and can be used to find the front of the previous chunk.
    The very first chunk allocated always has this bit set,
    preventing access to non-existent (or non-owned) memory. If
    prev_inuse is set for any given chunk, then you CANNOT determine
    the size of the previous chunk, and might even get a memory
    addressing fault when trying to do so.

    Note that the `foot' of the current chunk is actually represented
    as the prev_size of the NEXT chunk. This makes it easier to
    deal with alignments etc but can be very confusing when trying
    to extend or adapt this code.

    The two exceptions to all this are

     1. The special chunk `top' doesn't bother using the
        trailing size field since there is no next contiguous chunk
        that would have to index off it. After initialization, `top'
        is forced to always exist.  If it would become less than
        MINSIZE bytes long, it is replenished.

     2. Chunks allocated via mmap, which have the second-lowest-order
        bit (IS_MMAPPED) set in their size fields.  Because they are
        allocated one-by-one, each must contain its own trailing size field.

   * If USE_MALLOC_LOCK is defined, the mALLOC_MUTEx declared above.
   * If HAVE_MMAP is true, but mmap doesn't support

/*
  Bins

    An array of bin headers for free chunks. Each bin is doubly
    linked.  The bins are approximately proportionally (log) spaced.
    There are a lot of these bins (128). This may look excessive, but
    works very well in practice.  Most bins hold sizes that are
    unusual as malloc request sizes, but are more usual for fragments
    and consolidated sets of chunks, which is what these bins hold, so
    they can be found quickly.  All procedures maintain the invariant
    that no consolidated chunk physically borders another one, so each
    chunk in a list is known to be preceeded and followed by either
    inuse chunks or the ends of memory.

    Chunks in bins are kept in size order, with ties going to the
    approximately least recently used chunk. Ordering isn't needed
    for the small bins, which all contain the same-sized chunks, but
    facilitates best-fit allocation for larger chunks. These lists
    are just sequential. Keeping them in order almost never requires
    enough traversal to warrant using fancier ordered data
    structures.

    Chunks of the same size are linked with the most
    recently freed at the front, and allocations are taken from the
    back.  This results in LRU (FIFO) allocation order, which tends
    to give each chunk an equal opportunity to be consolidated with
    adjacent freed chunks, resulting in larger free chunks and less
    fragmentation.

    To simplify use in double-linked lists, each bin header acts
    as a malloc_chunk. This avoids special-casing for headers.
    But to conserve space and improve locality, we allocate
    only the fd/bk pointers of bins, and then use repositioning tricks
    to treat these as the fields of a malloc_chunk*.

  Indexing

    Bins for sizes < 512 bytes contain chunks of all the same size, spaced
    8 bytes apart. Larger bins are approximately logarithmically spaced:

    64 bins of size       8
    32 bins of size      64
    16 bins of size     512
     8 bins of size    4096
     4 bins of size   32768
     2 bins of size  262144
     1 bin  of size what's left

    There is actually a little bit of slop in the numbers in bin_index
    for the sake of speed. This makes no difference elsewhere.

    The bins top out around 1MB because we expect to service large

    code in malloc to check whether it even exists yet. But we still
    need to do so when getting memory from system, so we make

  -------------------- Alternative MORECORE functions --------------------

/*
  General Requirements for MORECORE.

  The MORECORE function must have the following properties:

  If MORECORE_CONTIGUOUS is false:

    * MORECORE must allocate in multiples of pagesize. It will
      only be called with arguments that are multiples of pagesize.

    * MORECORE(0) must return an address that is at least
      MALLOC_ALIGNMENT aligned. (Page-aligning always suffices.)

  else (i.e. If MORECORE_CONTIGUOUS is true):

    * Consecutive calls to MORECORE with positive arguments
      return increasing addresses, indicating that space has been
      contiguously extended.

    * MORECORE need not allocate in multiples of pagesize.
      Calls to MORECORE need not have args of multiples of pagesize.

    * MORECORE need not page-align.

  In either case:

    * MORECORE may allocate more memory than requested. (Or even less,
      but this will generally result in a malloc failure.)

    * MORECORE must not allocate memory when given argument zero, but
      instead return one past the end address of memory from previous
      nonzero call. This malloc does NOT call MORECORE(0)
      until at least one call with positive arguments is made, so
      the initial value returned is not important.

    * Even though consecutive calls to MORECORE need not return contiguous
      addresses, it must be OK for malloc'ed chunks to span multiple
      regions in those cases where they do happen to be contiguous.

    * MORECORE need not handle negative arguments -- it may instead
      just return MORECORE_FAILURE when given negative arguments.
      Negative arguments are always multiples of pagesize. MORECORE
      must not misinterpret negative args as large positive unsigned
      args. You can suppress all such calls from even occurring by defining
      MORECORE_CANNOT_TRIM,

  There is some variation across systems about the type of the
  argument to sbrk/MORECORE. If size_t is unsigned, then it cannot
  actually be size_t, because sbrk supports negative args, so it is
  normally the signed type of the same width as size_t (sometimes
  declared as "intptr_t", and sometimes "ptrdiff_t").  It doesn't much
  matter though. Internally, we use "long" as arguments, which should
  work across all reasonable possibilities.

  Additionally, if MORECORE ever returns failure for a positive
  request, and HAVE_MMAP is true, then mmap is used as a noncontiguous
  system allocator. This is a useful backup strategy for systems with
  holes in address spaces -- in this case sbrk cannot contiguously
  expand the heap, but mmap may be able to map noncontiguous space.

  If you'd like mmap to ALWAYS be used, you can define MORECORE to be
  a function that always returns MORECORE_FAILURE.

  If you are using this malloc with something other than sbrk (or its
  emulation) to supply memory regions, you probably want to set
  MORECORE_CONTIGUOUS as false.  As an example, here is a custom
  allocator kindly contributed for pre-OSX macOS.  It uses virtually
  but not necessarily physically contiguous non-paged memory (locked
  in, present and won't get swapped out).  You can use it by
  uncommenting this section, adding some #includes, and setting up the
  appropriate defines above:

      #define MORECORE osMoreCore
      #define MORECORE_CONTIGUOUS 0

  There is also a shutdown routine that should somehow be called for
  cleanup upon program exit.

  #define MAX_POOL_ENTRIES 100
  #define MINIMUM_MORECORE_SIZE  (64 * 1024)
  static int next_os_pool;
  void *our_os_pools[MAX_POOL_ENTRIES];

  void *osMoreCore(int size)
  {
    void *ptr = 0;
    static void *sbrk_top = 0;

    if (size > 0)
    {
      if (size < MINIMUM_MORECORE_SIZE)
         size = MINIMUM_MORECORE_SIZE;
      if (CurrentExecutionLevel() == kTaskLevel)
         ptr = PoolAllocateResident(size + RM_PAGE_SIZE, 0);
      if (ptr == 0)
      {
        return (void *) MORECORE_FAILURE;
      }
      // save ptrs so they can be freed during cleanup
      our_os_pools[next_os_pool] = ptr;
      next_os_pool++;
      ptr = (void *) ((((unsigned long) ptr) + RM_PAGE_MASK) & ~RM_PAGE_MASK);
      sbrk_top = (char *) ptr + size;
      return ptr;
    }
    else if (size < 0)
    {
      // we don't currently support shrink behavior
      return (void *) MORECORE_FAILURE;
    }
    else
    {
      return sbrk_top;
    }
  }

  // cleanup any allocated memory pools
  // called as last thing before shutting down driver

  void osCleanupMem(void)
  {
    void **ptr;

    for (ptr = our_os_pools; ptr < &our_os_pools[MAX_POOL_ENTRIES]; ptr++)
      if (*ptr)
      {
         PoolDeallocate(*ptr);
         *ptr = 0;
      }
  }
