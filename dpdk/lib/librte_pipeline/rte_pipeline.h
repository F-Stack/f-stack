/**
 * @file
 * RTE Pipeline
 *
 * This tool is part of the DPDK Packet Framework tool suite and provides
 * a standard methodology (logically similar to OpenFlow) for rapid development
 * of complex packet processing pipelines out of ports, tables and actions.
 *
 * <B>Basic operation.</B> A pipeline is constructed by connecting its input
 * ports to its output ports through a chain of lookup tables. As result of
 * lookup operation into the current table, one of the table entries (or the
 * default table entry, in case of lookup miss) is identified to provide the
 * actions to be executed on the current packet and the associated action
 * meta-data. The behavior of user actions is defined through the configurable
 * table action handler, while the reserved actions define the next hop for the
 * current packet (either another table, an output port or packet drop) and are
 * handled transparently by the framework.
 *
 * <B>Initialization and run-time flows.</B> Once all the pipeline elements
 * (input ports, tables, output ports) have been created, input ports connected
 * to tables, table action handlers configured, tables populated with the
 * initial set of entries (actions and action meta-data) and input ports
 * enabled, the pipeline runs automatically, pushing packets from input ports
 * to tables and output ports. At each table, the identified user actions are
 * being executed, resulting in action meta-data (stored in the table entry)
 * and packet meta-data (stored with the packet descriptor) being updated. The
 * pipeline tables can have further updates and input ports can be disabled or
 * enabled later on as required.
 *
 * <B>Multi-core scaling.</B> Typically, each CPU core will run its own
 * pipeline instance. Complex application-level pipelines can be implemented by
 * interconnecting multiple CPU core-level pipelines in tree-like topologies,
 * as the same port devices (e.g. SW rings) can serve as output ports for the
 * pipeline running on CPU core A, as well as input ports for the pipeline
 * running on CPU core B. This approach enables the application development
 * using the pipeline (CPU cores connected serially), cluster/run-to-completion
 * (CPU cores connected in parallel) or mixed (pipeline of CPU core clusters)
 * programming models.
 *
 * <B>Thread safety.</B> It is possible to have multiple pipelines running on
 * the same CPU core, but it is not allowed (for thread safety reasons) to have
 * multiple CPU cores running the same pipeline instance.

/**
 * Action handler packet drop
 *
 * This function is called by the pipeline action handlers (port in/out, table)
 * to drop the packets selected using packet mask.
 *
 * This function can be called by any input/output port or table action handler
 * to drop selected packets from the burst of packets read from one of the
 * pipeline input ports and currently processed by the pipeline. The dropped
 * packets are removed from any further pipeline processing and the packet
 * buffers are eventually freed to their buffer pool.
 *
 * This function updates the drop statistics counters correctly, therefore the
 * recommended approach for dropping packets by the action handlers is to call
 * this function as opposed to the action handler hijacking the packets first
 * and then dropping them invisibly to the pipeline (by using the
 * rte_pktmbuf_free() function).
 *
 * @param p
 *   Handle to pipeline instance
 * @param pkts_mask
 *   64-bit bitmask specifying which of the packets handed over for processing
 *   to the action handler is to be dropped by the action handler. When
 *   pkts_mask bit n is set, then element n of the pkts array (input argument to
 *   the action handler) is dropped.
