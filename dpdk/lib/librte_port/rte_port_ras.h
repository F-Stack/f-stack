/**
 * @file
 * RTE Port for IPv4 Reassembly
 *
 * This port is built on top of pre-initialized single producer rte_ring. In
 * order to minimize the amount of packets stored in the ring at any given
 * time, the IP reassembly functionality is executed on ring write operation,
 * hence this port is implemented as an output port. A regular ring_reader port
 * can be created to read from the same ring.
 *
 * The packets written to the ring are either complete IP datagrams or IP
 * fragments. The packets read from the ring are all complete IP datagrams,
 * either jumbo frames (i.e. IP packets with length bigger than MTU) or not.
 * The complete IP datagrams written to the ring are not changed. The IP
 * fragments written to the ring are first reassembled and into complete IP
 * datagrams or dropped on error or IP reassembly time-out.
