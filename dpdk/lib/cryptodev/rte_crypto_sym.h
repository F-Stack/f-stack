 * which contains the source data which the crypto operation is to be performed
 * on.
 * While the mbuf is in use by a crypto operation no part of the mbuf should be

 * may be DMAed in and out of the device, so writing over the original data,
 * though only the part specified by the rte_crypto_sym_op for transformation
 * will be changed.
 * Out-of-place (OOP) operation, where the source mbuf is different to the
 * destination mbuf, is a special case. Data will be copied from m_src to m_dst.
 * The part copied includes all the parts of the source mbuf that will be
 * operated on, based on the cipher.data.offset+cipher.data.length and
 * auth.data.offset+auth.data.length values in the rte_crypto_sym_op. The part
 * indicated by the cipher parameters will be transformed, any extra data around
 * this indicated by the auth parameters will be copied unchanged from source to
 * destination mbuf.
 * Also in OOP operation the cipher.data.offset and auth.data.offset apply to
 * both source and destination mbufs. As these offsets are relative to the
 * data_off parameter in each mbuf this can result in the data written to the
 * destination buffer being at a different alignment, relative to buffer start,
