/**

 * DPDK Metrics module
 *
 * Metrics are statistics that are not generated by PMDs, and hence
 * are better reported through a mechanism that is independent from
 * the ethdev-based extended statistics. Providers will typically
 * be other libraries and consumers will typically be applications.
 *
 * Metric information is populated using a push model, where producers
 * update the values contained within the metric library by calling
 * an update function on the relevant metrics. Consumers receive
 * metric information by querying the central metric data, which is
 * held in shared memory. Currently only bulk querying of metrics
 * by consumers is supported.
