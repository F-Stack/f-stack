 * RTE SWX Learner Table
 *
 * The learner table API.
 *
 * This table type is typically used for learning or connection tracking, where it allows for the
 * implementation of the "add on miss" scenario: whenever the lookup key is not found in the table
 * (lookup miss), the data plane can decide to add this key to the table with a given action with no
 * control plane intervention. Likewise, the table keys expire based on a configurable timeout and
 * are automatically deleted from the table with no control plane intervention.

 * operation for a given table and a given lookup key. The completion of the table lookup operation
 * is flagged by a return value of 1; in case of a return value of 0, the function must be invoked
 * again with exactly the same arguments.

 * The mailbox argument is used to store the context of an on-going table key lookup operation, and
 * possibly an associated key add operation. The mailbox mechanism allows for multiple concurrent
 * table key lookup and add operations into the same table.

 *   Mailbox for the current table lookup operation.
 * @param[in] time
 *   Current time measured in CPU clock cycles.
 * @param[in] key
 *   Lookup key. Its size must be equal to the table *key_size*.
 * @param[out] action_id
 *   ID of the action associated with the *key*. Must point to a valid 64-bit variable. Only valid
 *   when the function returns 1 and *hit* is set to true.
 * @param[out] action_data
 *   Action data for the *action_id* action. Must point to a valid array of table *action_data_size*
 *   bytes. Only valid when the function returns 1 and *hit* is set to true.
 * @param[out] hit
 *   Only valid when the function returns 1. Set to non-zero (true) on table lookup hit and to zero
 *   (false) on table lookup miss.

 *   0 when the table lookup operation is not yet completed, and 1 when the table lookup operation
 *   is completed. No other return values are allowed.
