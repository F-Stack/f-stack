/**
 * Segmentation function, which supports processing of both single- and
 * multi- MBUF packets.
 *
 * Note that we refer to the packets that are segmented from the input
 * packet as 'GSO segments'. rte_gso_segment() doesn't check if the
 * input packet has correct checksums, and doesn't update checksums for
 * output GSO segments. Additionally, it doesn't process IP fragment
 * packets.
 *
 * Before calling rte_gso_segment(), applications must set proper ol_flags
 * for the packet. The GSO library uses the same macros as that of TSO.
 * For example, set PKT_TX_TCP_SEG and PKT_TX_IPV4 in ol_flags to segment
 * a TCP/IPv4 packet. If rte_gso_segment() succeeds, the PKT_TX_TCP_SEG
 * flag is removed for all GSO segments and the input packet.
 *
 * Each of the newly-created GSO segments is organized as a two-segment
 * MBUF, where the first segment is a standard MBUF, which stores a copy
 * of packet header, and the second is an indirect MBUF which points to
 * a section of data in the input packet. Since each GSO segment has
 * multiple MBUFs (i.e. typically 2 MBUFs), the driver of the interface which
 * the GSO segments are sent to should support transmission of multi-segment
 * packets.
 *
 * If the input packet is GSO'd, all the indirect segments are attached to the
 * input packet.
 *
 * rte_gso_segment() will not free the input packet no matter whether it is
 * GSO'd or not, the application should free it after calling rte_gso_segment().
 *
 * If the memory space in pkts_out or MBUF pools is insufficient, this
 * function fails, and it returns (-1) * errno. Otherwise, GSO succeeds,
 * and this function returns the number of output GSO segments filled in
 * pkts_out.
 *
 * @param pkt
 *  The packet mbuf to segment.
 * @param ctx
 *  GSO context object pointer.
 * @param pkts_out
 *  Pointer array used to store the MBUF addresses of output GSO
 *  segments, when rte_gso_segment() succeeds.
 * @param nb_pkts_out
 *  The max number of items that pkts_out can keep.
 *
 * @return
 *  - The number of GSO segments filled in pkts_out on success.
 *  - Return 0 if it does not need to be GSO'd.
 *  - Return -ENOMEM if run out of memory in MBUF pools.
 *  - Return -EINVAL for invalid parameters.
