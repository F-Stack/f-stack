 *                                   +

 *
 * - It has a virtual monotonically increasing 64-bit timer adapter clock based
 *   on *enum rte_event_timer_adapter_clk_src* clock source. The clock source
 *   could be a CPU clock, or a platform dependent external clock.
 *
 * - The application creates a timer adapter instance with given the clock
 *   source, the total number of event timers, and a resolution(expressed in ns)
 *   to traverse between the buckets.
 *
 * - Each timer adapter may have 0 to n buckets based on the configured
 *   max timeout(max_tmo_ns) and resolution(timer_tick_ns). Upon starting the
 *   timer adapter, the adapter starts ticking at *timer_tick_ns* resolution.
 *
 * - The application arms an event timer that will expire *timer_tick_ns*
 *   from now.
 *
 * - The application can cancel an armed timer and no timer expiry event will be
 *   generated.
 *
 * - If a timer expires then the library injects the timer expiry event in
 *   the designated event queue.
 *
 * - The timer expiry event will be received through *rte_event_dequeue_burst*.
 *
 * - The application frees the timer adapter instance.
 *
 * Multiple timer adapters can be created with a varying level of resolution
 * for various expiry use cases that run in parallel.
 *
 * Before using the timer adapter, the application has to create and configure
 * an event device along with the event port. Based on the event device
 * capability it might require creating an additional event port to be used
 * by the timer adapter.
 *
 * The application creates the event timer adapter using the
 * ``rte_event_timer_adapter_create()``. The event device id is passed to this
 * function, inside this function the event device capability is checked,
 * and if an in-built port is absent the application uses the default
 * function to create a new producer port.
 *
 * The application may also use the function
 * ``rte_event_timer_adapter_create_ext()`` to have granular control over
 * producer port creation in a case where the in-built port is absent.
 *
 * After creating the timer adapter, the application has to start it
 * using ``rte_event_timer_adapter_start()``. The buckets are traversed from
 * 0 to n; when the adapter ticks, the next bucket is visited. Each time,
 * the list per bucket is processed, and timer expiry events are sent to the
 * designated event queue.
 *
 * The application can arm one or more event timers using the
 * ``rte_event_timer_arm_burst()``. The *timeout_ticks* represents the number
 * of *timer_tick_ns* after which the timer has to expire. The timeout at
 * which the timers expire can be grouped or be independent of each
 * event timer instance. ``rte_event_timer_arm_tmo_tick_burst()`` addresses the
 * former case and ``rte_event_timer_arm_burst()`` addresses the latter case.
 *
 * The application can cancel the timers from expiring using the
 * ``rte_event_timer_cancel_burst()``.
 *
 * On the secondary process, ``rte_event_timer_adapter_lookup()`` can be used
 * to get the timer adapter pointer from its id and use it to invoke fastpath
 * operations such as arm and cancel.
 *
 * Some of the use cases of event timer adapter are Beacon Timers,
 * Generic SW Timeout, Wireless MAC Scheduling, 3G Frame Protocols,
 * Packet Scheduling, Protocol Retransmission Timers, Supervision Timers.
 * All these use cases require high resolution and low time drift.

 * @param adapter

 * @param nb_evtims
 *   Number of event timer instances in the supplied array.
 *
 * @return
 *   The number of successfully canceled event timers. The return value can be

 *   - EINVAL Invalid timer adapter identifier
 *   - EAGAIN Specified timer adapter is not running
 *   - EALREADY  A timer was encountered that was already canceled
