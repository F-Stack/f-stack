 * RTE Event Device API
 *
 * In a polling model, lcores poll ethdev ports and associated rx queues
 * directly to look for packet. In an event driven model, by contrast, lcores
 * call the scheduler that selects packets for them based on programmer
 * specified criteria. Eventdev library adds support for event driven
 * programming model, which offer applications automatic multicore scaling,
 * dynamic load balancing, pipelining, packet ingress order maintenance and
 * synchronization services to simplify application packet processing.
 *
 * The Event Device API is composed of two parts:
 *
 * - The application-oriented Event API that includes functions to setup
 *   an event device (configure it, setup its queues, ports and start it), to
 *   establish the link between queues to port and to receive events, and so on.
 *
 * - The driver-oriented Event API that exports a function allowing
 *   an event poll Mode Driver (PMD) to simultaneously register itself as
 *   an event device driver.
 *
 * Event device components:

 *
 * Event device: A hardware or software-based event scheduler.
 *
 * Event: A unit of scheduling that encapsulates a packet or other datatype
 * like SW generated event from the CPU, Crypto work completion notification,
 * Timer expiry event notification etc as well as metadata.
 * The metadata includes flow ID, scheduling type, event priority, event_type,
 * sub_event_type etc.
 *
 * Event queue: A queue containing events that are scheduled by the event dev.
 * An event queue contains events of different flows associated with scheduling
 * types, such as atomic, ordered, or parallel.
 *
 * Event port: An application's interface into the event dev for enqueue and
 * dequeue operations. Each event port can be linked with one or more
 * event queues for dequeue operations.
 *
 * By default, all the functions of the Event Device API exported by a PMD
 * are lock-free functions which assume to not be invoked in parallel on
 * different logical cores to work on the same target object. For instance,
 * the dequeue function of a PMD cannot be invoked in parallel on two logical
 * cores to operates on same  event port. Of course, this function
 * can be invoked in parallel by different logical cores on different ports.
 * It is the responsibility of the upper level application to enforce this rule.
 *
 * In all functions of the Event API, the Event device is
 * designated by an integer >= 0 named the device identifier *dev_id*
 *
 * At the Event driver level, Event devices are represented by a generic
 * data structure of type *rte_event_dev*.
 *
 * Event devices are dynamically registered during the PCI/SoC device probing
 * phase performed at EAL initialization time.
 * When an Event device is being probed, a *rte_event_dev* structure and
 * a new device identifier are allocated for that device. Then, the
 * event_dev_init() function supplied by the Event driver matching the probed
 * device is invoked to properly initialize the device.
 *
 * The role of the device init function consists of resetting the hardware or
 * software event driver implementations.
 *
 * If the device init operation is successful, the correspondence between
 * the device identifier assigned to the new device and its associated
 * *rte_event_dev* structure is effectively registered.
 * Otherwise, both the *rte_event_dev* structure and the device identifier are
 * freed.
 *
 * The functions exported by the application Event API to setup a device
 * designated by its device identifier must be invoked in the following order:
 *     - rte_event_dev_configure()
 *     - rte_event_queue_setup()
 *     - rte_event_port_setup()
 *     - rte_event_port_link()
 *     - rte_event_dev_start()
 *
 * Then, the application can invoke, in any order, the functions
 * exported by the Event API to schedule events, dequeue events, enqueue events,
 * change event queue(s) to event port [un]link establishment and so on.
 *
 * Application may use rte_event_[queue/port]_default_conf_get() to get the
 * default configuration to set up an event queue or event port by
 * overriding few default values.
 *
 * If the application wants to change the configuration (i.e. call
 * rte_event_dev_configure(), rte_event_queue_setup(), or
 * rte_event_port_setup()), it must call rte_event_dev_stop() first to stop the
 * device and then do the reconfiguration before calling rte_event_dev_start()
 * again. The schedule, enqueue and dequeue functions should not be invoked
 * when the device is stopped.
 *
 * Finally, an application can close an Event device by invoking the
 * rte_event_dev_close() function.
 *
 * Each function of the application Event API invokes a specific function
 * of the PMD that controls the target device designated by its device
 * identifier.
 *
 * For this purpose, all device-specific functions of an Event driver are
 * supplied through a set of pointers contained in a generic structure of type
 * *event_dev_ops*.
 * The address of the *event_dev_ops* structure is stored in the *rte_event_dev*
 * structure by the device init function of the Event driver, which is
 * invoked during the PCI/SoC device probing phase, as explained earlier.
 *
 * In other words, each function of the Event API simply retrieves the
 * *rte_event_dev* structure associated with the device identifier and
 * performs an indirect invocation of the corresponding driver function
 * supplied in the *event_dev_ops* structure of the *rte_event_dev* structure.
 *
 * For performance reasons, the address of the fast-path functions of the
 * Event driver is not contained in the *event_dev_ops* structure.
 * Instead, they are directly stored at the beginning of the *rte_event_dev*
 * structure to avoid an extra indirect memory access during their invocation.
 *
 * RTE event device drivers do not use interrupts for enqueue or dequeue
 * operation. Instead, Event drivers export Poll-Mode enqueue and dequeue
 * functions to applications.
 *
 * The events are injected to event device through *enqueue* operation by
 * event producers in the system. The typical event producers are ethdev
 * subsystem for generating packet events, CPU(SW) for generating events based
 * on different stages of application processing, cryptodev for generating
 * crypto work completion notification etc
 *
 * The *dequeue* operation gets one or more events from the event ports.
 * The application process the events and send to downstream event queue through
 * rte_event_enqueue_burst() if it is an intermediate stage of event processing,
 * on the final stage, the application may use Tx adapter API for maintaining
 * the ingress order and then send the packet/event on the wire.
 *
 * The point at which events are scheduled to ports depends on the device.
 * For hardware devices, scheduling occurs asynchronously without any software
 * intervention. Software schedulers can either be distributed
 * (each worker thread schedules events to its own port) or centralized
 * (a dedicated thread schedules to all ports). Distributed software schedulers
 * perform the scheduling in rte_event_dequeue_burst(), whereas centralized
 * scheduler logic need a dedicated service core for scheduling.
 * The RTE_EVENT_DEV_CAP_DISTRIBUTED_SCHED capability flag is not set
 * indicates the device is centralized and thus needs a dedicated scheduling
 * thread that repeatedly calls software specific scheduling function.
 *
 * An event driven worker thread has following typical workflow on fastpath:
 * \code{.c}
 *	while (1) {
 *		rte_event_dequeue_burst(...);
 *		(event processing)
 *		rte_event_enqueue_burst(...);
 *	}
 * \endcode
