 *
 * When no tokens are defined (tokens[0] == NULL), they are retrieved
 * dynamically by calling f() as follows:
 *
 * @code
 *
 * f((struct cmdline_token_hdr **)&token_p,
 *   NULL,

 *
 * The address of the resulting token is expected at the location pointed by
 * the first argument. Can be set to NULL to end the list.
 *
 * The cmdline argument (struct cmdline *) is always NULL.
 *
 * The last argument points to the inst->tokens[] entry to retrieve, which
 * is not necessarily inside allocated memory and should neither be read nor
 * written. Its sole purpose is to deduce the token entry index of interest
 * as described in the example below.
 *
 * Note about constraints:
 *
 * - Only the address of these tokens is dynamic, their storage should be
 *   static like normal tokens.
 * - Dynamic token lists that need to maintain an internal context (e.g. in
 *   order to determine the next token) must store it statically also. This
 *   context must be reinitialized when the first token is requested, that
 *   is, when &inst->tokens[0] is provided as the third argument.
 * - Dynamic token lists must be NULL-terminated to generate usable
 *   commands.
 *
 * @code
 *
 * // Assuming first and third arguments are respectively named "token_p"
 * // and "token":
 *
 * int index = token - inst->tokens;
 *

 *     [...] // Clean up internal context if any.
 * }
