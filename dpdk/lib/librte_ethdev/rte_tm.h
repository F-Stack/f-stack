 * weights. The WFQ weight of a given child node is relative to the sum of the

 *
 * This function has to be called for both leaf and non-leaf nodes. In the case
 * of leaf nodes (i.e. *node_id* is within the range of 0 .. (N-1), with N as
 * the number of configured TX queues of the current port), the leaf node is
 * configured rather than created (as the set of leaf nodes is predefined) and
 * it is also connected as child of an existing node.
 *
 * The first node that is added becomes the root node and all the nodes that
 * are subsequently added have to be added as descendants of the root node. The
 * parent of the root node has to be specified as RTE_TM_NODE_ID_NULL and there
 * can only be one node with this parent ID (i.e. the root node). Further

/**
 * Traffic manager packet marking - IPv4 / IPv6 DSCP (IETF RFC 2597)
 *
 * IETF RFC 2597 maps the traffic class and the drop priority to the IPv4/IPv6
 * Differentiated Services Codepoint (DSCP) field (6 bits). Here are the DSCP
 * values proposed by this RFC:
 *
 * <pre>                   Class 1    Class 2    Class 3    Class 4   </pre>
 * <pre>                 +----------+----------+----------+----------+</pre>
 * <pre>Low Drop Prec    |  001010  |  010010  |  011010  |  100010  |</pre>
 * <pre>Medium Drop Prec |  001100  |  010100  |  011100  |  100100  |</pre>
 * <pre>High Drop Prec   |  001110  |  010110  |  011110  |  100110  |</pre>
 * <pre>                 +----------+----------+----------+----------+</pre>
 *
 * There are 4 traffic classes (classes 1 .. 4) encoded by DSCP bits 1 and 2,
 * as well as 3 drop priorities (low/medium/high) encoded by DSCP bits 3 and 4.
 *
 * All IPv4/IPv6 packets have their color marked into DSCP bits 3 and 4 as
 * follows: green mapped to Low Drop Precedence (2’b01), yellow to Medium
 * (2’b10) and red to High (2’b11). Marking needs to be explicitly enabled
 * for each color; when not enabled for a given color, the DSCP field of all
 * packets with that color is left as is.
 *
 * @param[in] port_id
 *   The port identifier of the Ethernet device.
 * @param[in] mark_green
 *   Set to non-zero value to enable marking of green packets and to zero to
 *   disable it.
 * @param[in] mark_yellow
 *   Set to non-zero value to enable marking of yellow packets and to zero to
 *   disable it.
 * @param[in] mark_red
 *   Set to non-zero value to enable marking of red packets and to zero to
 *   disable it.
 * @param[out] error
 *   Error details. Filled in only on error, when not NULL.
 * @return
 *   0 on success, non-zero error code otherwise.
