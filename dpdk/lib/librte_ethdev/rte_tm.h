 *
 * This function has to be called for both leaf and non-leaf nodes. In the case
 * of leaf nodes (i.e. *node_id* is within the range of 0 .. (N-1), with N as
 * the number of configured TX queues of the current port), the leaf node is
 * configured rather than created (as the set of leaf nodes is predefined) and
 * it is also connected as child of an existing node.
 *
 * The first node that is added becomes the root node and all the nodes that
 * are subsequently added have to be added as descendants of the root node. The
 * parent of the root node has to be specified as RTE_TM_NODE_ID_NULL and there
 * can only be one node with this parent ID (i.e. the root node). Further
 * restrictions for root node: needs to be non-leaf, its private shaper profile
 * needs to be valid and single rate, cannot use any shared shapers.
 *
 * When called before rte_tm_hierarchy_commit() invocation, this function is
 * typically used to define the initial start-up hierarchy for the port.

 * advertised in the port capability set), this function can be also called
 * after the rte_tm_hierarchy_commit() invocation.

 *   Node priority. The highest node priority is zero. Used by the SP algorithm

 *   Node weight. The node weight is relative to the weight sum of all siblings
 *   that have the same priority. The lowest weight is one. Used by the WFQ
 *   algorithm running on the parent of the current node for scheduling this
 *   child node.
 * @param[in] level_id
 *   Level ID that should be met by this node. The hierarchy level of the
 *   current node is already fully specified through its parent node (i.e. the
 *   level of this node is equal to the level of its parent node plus one),
 *   therefore the reason for providing this parameter is to enable the
