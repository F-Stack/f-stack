 * RTE Generic Traffic Metering and Policing API
 *
 * This interface provides the ability to configure the traffic metering and
 * policing (MTR) in a generic way.
 *
 * The processing done for each input packet hitting a MTR object is:
 *    A) Traffic metering: The packet is assigned a color (the meter output
 *       color), based on the previous history of the flow reflected in the
 *       current state of the MTR object, according to the specific traffic
 *       metering algorithm. The traffic metering algorithm can typically work
 *       in color aware mode, in which case the input packet already has an
 *       initial color (the input color), or in color blind mode, which is
 *       equivalent to considering all input packets initially colored as green.
 *    B) Policing: There is a separate policer action configured for each meter
 *       output color, which can:
 *          a) Drop the packet.
 *          b) Keep the same packet color: the policer output color matches the
 *             meter output color (essentially a no-op action).
 *          c) Recolor the packet: the policer output color is different than
 *             the meter output color.
 *       The policer output color is the output color of the packet, which is
 *       set in the packet meta-data (i.e. struct rte_mbuf::sched::color).
 *    C) Statistics: The set of counters maintained for each MTR object is
 *       configurable and subject to the implementation support. This set
 *       includes the number of packets and bytes dropped or passed for each
 *       output color.
 *
 * Once successfully created, an MTR object is linked to one or several flows
 * through the meter action of the flow API.
 *    A) Whether an MTR object is private to a flow or potentially shared by
 *       several flows has to be specified at creation time.
 *    B) Several meter actions can be potentially registered for the same flow.
 *
 * @warning
 * @b EXPERIMENTAL: this API may change without prior notice
