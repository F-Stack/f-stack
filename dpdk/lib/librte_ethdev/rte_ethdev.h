 * RTE Ethernet Device API
 *
 * The Ethernet Device API is composed of two parts:
 *
 * - The application-oriented Ethernet API that includes functions to setup
 *   an Ethernet device (configure it, setup its RX and TX queues and start it),
 *   to get its MAC address, the speed and the status of its physical link,
 *   to receive and to transmit packets, and so on.
 *
 * - The driver-oriented Ethernet API that exports functions allowing
 *   an Ethernet Poll Mode Driver (PMD) to allocate an Ethernet device instance,
 *   create memzone for HW rings and process registered callbacks, and so on.
 *   PMDs should include rte_ethdev_driver.h instead of this header.
 *
 * By default, all the functions of the Ethernet Device API exported by a PMD
 * are lock-free functions which assume to not be invoked in parallel on
 * different logical cores to work on the same target object.  For instance,
 * the receive function of a PMD cannot be invoked in parallel on two logical
 * cores to poll the same RX queue [of the same port]. Of course, this function
 * can be invoked in parallel by different logical cores on different RX queues.
 * It is the responsibility of the upper level application to enforce this rule.
 *
 * If needed, parallel accesses by multiple logical cores to shared queues
 * shall be explicitly protected by dedicated inline lock-aware functions
 * built on top of their corresponding lock-free functions of the PMD API.
 *
 * In all functions of the Ethernet API, the Ethernet device is
 * designated by an integer >= 0 named the device port identifier.
 *
 * At the Ethernet driver level, Ethernet devices are represented by a generic
 * data structure of type *rte_eth_dev*.
 *
 * Ethernet devices are dynamically registered during the PCI probing phase
 * performed at EAL initialization time.
 * When an Ethernet device is being probed, an *rte_eth_dev* structure and
 * a new port identifier are allocated for that device. Then, the eth_dev_init()
 * function supplied by the Ethernet driver matching the probed PCI
 * device is invoked to properly initialize the device.
 *
 * The role of the device init function consists of resetting the hardware,
 * checking access to Non-volatile Memory (NVM), reading the MAC address
 * from NVM etc.
 *
 * If the device init operation is successful, the correspondence between
 * the port identifier assigned to the new device and its associated
 * *rte_eth_dev* structure is effectively registered.
 * Otherwise, both the *rte_eth_dev* structure and the port identifier are
 * freed.
 *
 * The functions exported by the application Ethernet API to setup a device
 * designated by its port identifier must be invoked in the following order:
 *     - rte_eth_dev_configure()
 *     - rte_eth_tx_queue_setup()
 *     - rte_eth_rx_queue_setup()
 *     - rte_eth_dev_start()
 *
 * Then, the network application can invoke, in any order, the functions
 * exported by the Ethernet API to get the MAC address of a given device, to
 * get the speed and the status of a device physical link, to receive/transmit
 * [burst of] packets, and so on.
 *
 * If the application wants to change the configuration (i.e. call
 * rte_eth_dev_configure(), rte_eth_tx_queue_setup(), or
 * rte_eth_rx_queue_setup()), it must call rte_eth_dev_stop() first to stop the
 * device and then do the reconfiguration before calling rte_eth_dev_start()
 * again. The transmit and receive functions should not be invoked when the
 * device is stopped.
 *
 * Please note that some configuration is not stored between calls to
 * rte_eth_dev_stop()/rte_eth_dev_start(). The following configuration will
 * be retained:
 *
 *     - flow control settings
 *     - receive mode configuration (promiscuous mode, hardware checksum mode,
 *       RSS/VMDQ settings etc.)
 *     - VLAN filtering configuration
 *     - MAC addresses supplied to MAC address array
 *     - flow director filtering mode (but not filtering rules)
 *     - NIC queue statistics mappings
 *
 * Any other configuration will not be stored and will need to be re-entered
 * before a call to rte_eth_dev_start().
 *
 * Finally, a network application can close an Ethernet device by invoking the
 * rte_eth_dev_close() function.
 *
 * Each function of the application Ethernet API invokes a specific function
 * of the PMD that controls the target device designated by its port
 * identifier.
 * For this purpose, all device-specific functions of an Ethernet driver are
 * supplied through a set of pointers contained in a generic structure of type
 * *eth_dev_ops*.
 * The address of the *eth_dev_ops* structure is stored in the *rte_eth_dev*
 * structure by the device init function of the Ethernet driver, which is
 * invoked during the PCI probing phase, as explained earlier.
 *
 * In other words, each function of the Ethernet API simply retrieves the
 * *rte_eth_dev* structure associated with the device port identifier and
 * performs an indirect invocation of the corresponding driver function
 * supplied in the *eth_dev_ops* structure of the *rte_eth_dev* structure.
 *
 * For performance reasons, the address of the burst-oriented RX and TX
 * functions of the Ethernet driver are not contained in the *eth_dev_ops*
 * structure. Instead, they are directly stored at the beginning of the
 * *rte_eth_dev* structure to avoid an extra indirect memory access during
 * their invocation.
 *
 * RTE ethernet device drivers do not use interrupts for transmitting or
 * receiving. Instead, Ethernet drivers export Poll-Mode receive and transmit
 * functions to applications.
 * Both receive and transmit functions are packet-burst oriented to minimize
 * their cost per packet through the following optimizations:
 *
 * - Sharing among multiple packets the incompressible cost of the
 *   invocation of receive/transmit functions.
 *
 * - Enabling receive/transmit functions to take advantage of burst-oriented
 *   hardware features (L1 cache, prefetch instructions, NIC head/tail
 *   registers) to minimize the number of CPU cycles per packet, for instance,
 *   by avoiding useless read memory accesses to ring descriptors, or by
 *   systematically using arrays of pointers that exactly fit L1 cache line
 *   boundaries and sizes.
 *
 * The burst-oriented receive function does not provide any error notification,
 * to avoid the corresponding overhead. As a hint, the upper-level application
 * might check the status of the device link once being systematically returned
 * a 0 value by the receive function of the driver for a given number of tries.

/**
 *
 * Retrieve a burst of input packets from a receive queue of an Ethernet
 * device. The retrieved packets are stored in *rte_mbuf* structures whose
 * pointers are supplied in the *rx_pkts* array.
 *
 * The rte_eth_rx_burst() function loops, parsing the RX ring of the
 * receive queue, up to *nb_pkts* packets, and for each completed RX
 * descriptor in the ring, it performs the following operations:
 *
 * - Initialize the *rte_mbuf* data structure associated with the
 *   RX descriptor according to the information provided by the NIC into
 *   that RX descriptor.
 *
 * - Store the *rte_mbuf* data structure into the next entry of the
 *   *rx_pkts* array.
 *
 * - Replenish the RX descriptor with a new *rte_mbuf* buffer
 *   allocated from the memory pool associated with the receive queue at
 *   initialization time.
 *
 * When retrieving an input packet that was scattered by the controller
 * into multiple receive descriptors, the rte_eth_rx_burst() function
 * appends the associated *rte_mbuf* buffers to the first buffer of the
 * packet.
 *
 * The rte_eth_rx_burst() function returns the number of packets
 * actually retrieved, which is the number of *rte_mbuf* data structures
 * effectively supplied into the *rx_pkts* array.
 * A return value equal to *nb_pkts* indicates that the RX queue contained
 * at least *rx_pkts* packets, and this is likely to signify that other
 * received packets remain in the input queue. Applications implementing
 * a "retrieve as much received packets as possible" policy can check this
 * specific case and keep invoking the rte_eth_rx_burst() function until
 * a value less than *nb_pkts* is returned.
 *
 * This receive method has the following advantages:
 *
 * - It allows a run-to-completion network stack engine to retrieve and
 *   to immediately process received packets in a fast burst-oriented
 *   approach, avoiding the overhead of unnecessary intermediate packet
 *   queue/dequeue operations.
 *
 * - Conversely, it also allows an asynchronous-oriented processing
 *   method to retrieve bursts of received packets and to immediately
 *   queue them for further parallel processing by another logical core,
 *   for instance. However, instead of having received packets being
 *   individually queued by the driver, this approach allows the caller
 *   of the rte_eth_rx_burst() function to queue a burst of retrieved
 *   packets at a time and therefore dramatically reduce the cost of
 *   enqueue/dequeue operations per packet.
 *
 * - It allows the rte_eth_rx_burst() function of the driver to take
 *   advantage of burst-oriented hardware features (CPU cache,
 *   prefetch instructions, and so on) to minimize the number of CPU
 *   cycles per packet.
 *
 * To summarize, the proposed receive API enables many
 * burst-oriented optimizations in both synchronous and asynchronous
 * packet processing environments with no overhead in both cases.
 *

/**
 * Send a burst of output packets on a transmit queue of an Ethernet device.
 *
 * The rte_eth_tx_burst() function is invoked to transmit output packets
 * on the output queue *queue_id* of the Ethernet device designated by its
 * *port_id*.
 * The *nb_pkts* parameter is the number of packets to send which are
 * supplied in the *tx_pkts* array of *rte_mbuf* structures, each of them
 * allocated from a pool created with rte_pktmbuf_pool_create().
 * The rte_eth_tx_burst() function loops, sending *nb_pkts* packets,
 * up to the number of transmit descriptors available in the TX ring of the
 * transmit queue.
 * For each packet to send, the rte_eth_tx_burst() function performs
 * the following operations:
 *
 * - Pick up the next available descriptor in the transmit ring.
 *
 * - Free the network buffer previously sent with that descriptor, if any.
 *
 * - Initialize the transmit descriptor with the information provided
 *   in the *rte_mbuf data structure.
 *
 * In the case of a segmented packet composed of a list of *rte_mbuf* buffers,
 * the rte_eth_tx_burst() function uses several transmit descriptors
 * of the ring.
 *
 * The rte_eth_tx_burst() function returns the number of packets it
 * actually sent. A return value equal to *nb_pkts* means that all packets
 * have been sent, and this is likely to signify that other output packets
 * could be immediately transmitted again. Applications that implement a
 * "send as many packets to transmit as possible" policy can check this
 * specific case and keep invoking the rte_eth_tx_burst() function until
 * a value less than *nb_pkts* is returned.
 *
 * It is the responsibility of the rte_eth_tx_burst() function to
 * transparently free the memory buffers of packets previously sent.
 * This feature is driven by the *tx_free_thresh* value supplied to the
 * rte_eth_dev_configure() function at device configuration time.
 * When the number of free TX descriptors drops below this threshold, the
 * rte_eth_tx_burst() function must [attempt to] free the *rte_mbuf*  buffers
 * of those packets whose transmission was effectively completed.
 *
 * If the PMD is DEV_TX_OFFLOAD_MT_LOCKFREE capable, multiple threads can
 * invoke this function concurrently on the same tx queue without SW lock.
 * @see rte_eth_dev_info_get, struct rte_eth_txconf::offloads
 *
 * @see rte_eth_tx_prepare to perform some prior checks or adjustments
 * for offloads.
 *
 * @param port_id
 *   The port identifier of the Ethernet device.
 * @param queue_id
 *   The index of the transmit queue through which output packets must be
 *   sent.
 *   The value must be in the range [0, nb_tx_queue - 1] previously supplied
 *   to rte_eth_dev_configure().
 * @param tx_pkts
 *   The address of an array of *nb_pkts* pointers to *rte_mbuf* structures
 *   which contain the output packets.
 * @param nb_pkts
 *   The maximum number of packets to transmit.
 * @return
 *   The number of output packets actually stored in transmit descriptors of
 *   the transmit ring. The return value can be less than the value of the
 *   *tx_pkts* parameter when the transmit ring is full or has been filled up.
