 * RTE Quiescent State Based Reclamation (QSBR).

 * @warning
 * @b EXPERIMENTAL:
 * All functions in this file may be changed or removed without prior notice.
 *
 * Quiescent State (QS) is any point in the thread execution
 * where the thread does not hold a reference to a data structure
 * in shared memory. While using lock-less data structures, the writer
 * can safely free memory once all the reader threads have entered
 * quiescent state.
 *
 * This library provides the ability for the readers to report quiescent
 * state and for the writers to identify when all the readers have
 * entered quiescent state.
