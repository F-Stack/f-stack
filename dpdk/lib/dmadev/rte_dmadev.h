 * DMA (Direct Memory Access) device API.
 *
 * The DMA framework is built on the following model:
 *

 *     | virtual DMA |   | virtual DMA |       | virtual DMA |
 *     | channel     |   | channel     |       | channel     |

 *            | HW DMA channel |               | HW DMA channel |
 *            ------------------               ------------------
 *                     |                              |
 *                     --------------------------------
 *                                     |
 *                           ---------------------
 *                           | HW DMA Controller |
 *                           ---------------------
 *
 * The DMA controller could have multiple HW-DMA-channels (aka. HW-DMA-queues),
 * each HW-DMA-channel should be represented by a dmadev.
 *
 * The dmadev could create multiple virtual DMA channels, each virtual DMA
 * channel represents a different transfer context. The DMA operation request
 * must be submitted to the virtual DMA channel. e.g. Application could create
 * virtual DMA channel 0 for memory-to-memory transfer scenario, and create
 * virtual DMA channel 1 for memory-to-device transfer scenario.
 *
 * This framework uses 'int16_t dev_id' as the device identifier of a dmadev,
 * and 'uint16_t vchan' as the virtual DMA channel identifier in one dmadev.
 *
 * The functions exported by the dmadev API to setup a device designated by its
 * device identifier must be invoked in the following order:
 *     - rte_dma_configure()
 *     - rte_dma_vchan_setup()
 *     - rte_dma_start()
 *
 * Then, the application can invoke dataplane functions to process jobs.
 *
 * If the application wants to change the configuration (i.e. invoke
 * rte_dma_configure() or rte_dma_vchan_setup()), it must invoke
 * rte_dma_stop() first to stop the device and then do the reconfiguration
 * before invoking rte_dma_start() again. The dataplane functions should not
 * be invoked when the device is stopped.
 *
 * Finally, an application can close a dmadev by invoking the rte_dma_close()
 * function.
 *
 * The dataplane APIs include two parts:
 * The first part is the submission of operation requests:
 *     - rte_dma_copy()
 *     - rte_dma_copy_sg()
 *     - rte_dma_fill()
 *     - rte_dma_submit()
 *
 * These APIs could work with different virtual DMA channels which have
 * different contexts.
 *
 * The first three APIs are used to submit the operation request to the virtual
 * DMA channel, if the submission is successful, a positive
 * ring_idx <= UINT16_MAX is returned, otherwise a negative number is returned.
 *
 * The last API is used to issue doorbell to hardware, and also there are flags
 * (@see RTE_DMA_OP_FLAG_SUBMIT) parameter of the first three APIs could do the
 * same work.
 * @note When enqueuing a set of jobs to the device, having a separate submit
 * outside a loop makes for clearer code than having a check for the last
 * iteration inside the loop to set a special submit flag.  However, for cases
 * where one item alone is to be submitted or there is a small set of jobs to
 * be submitted sequentially, having a submit flag provides a lower-overhead
 * way of doing the submission while still keeping the code clean.
 *
 * The second part is to obtain the result of requests:
 *     - rte_dma_completed()
 *         - return the number of operation requests completed successfully.
 *     - rte_dma_completed_status()
 *         - return the number of operation requests completed.
 *
 * @note If the dmadev works in silent mode (@see RTE_DMA_CAPA_SILENT),
 * application does not invoke the above two completed APIs.
 *
 * About the ring_idx which enqueue APIs (e.g. rte_dma_copy(), rte_dma_fill())
 * return, the rules are as follows:
 *     - ring_idx for each virtual DMA channel are independent.
 *     - For a virtual DMA channel, the ring_idx is monotonically incremented,
 *       when it reach UINT16_MAX, it wraps back to zero.
 *     - This ring_idx can be used by applications to track per-operation
 *       metadata in an application-defined circular ring.
 *     - The initial ring_idx of a virtual DMA channel is zero, after the
 *       device is stopped, the ring_idx needs to be reset to zero.
 *
 * One example:
 *     - step-1: start one dmadev
 *     - step-2: enqueue a copy operation, the ring_idx return is 0
 *     - step-3: enqueue a copy operation again, the ring_idx return is 1
 *     - ...
 *     - step-101: stop the dmadev
 *     - step-102: start the dmadev
 *     - step-103: enqueue a copy operation, the ring_idx return is 0
 *     - ...
 *     - step-x+0: enqueue a fill operation, the ring_idx return is 65535
 *     - step-x+1: enqueue a copy operation, the ring_idx return is 0
 *     - ...
 *
 * The DMA operation address used in enqueue APIs (i.e. rte_dma_copy(),
 * rte_dma_copy_sg(), rte_dma_fill()) is defined as rte_iova_t type.
 *
 * The dmadev supports two types of address: memory address and device address.
 *
 * - memory address: the source and destination address of the memory-to-memory
 * transfer type, or the source address of the memory-to-device transfer type,
 * or the destination address of the device-to-memory transfer type.
 * @note If the device support SVA (@see RTE_DMA_CAPA_SVA), the memory address
 * can be any VA address, otherwise it must be an IOVA address.
 *
 * - device address: the source and destination address of the device-to-device
 * transfer type, or the source address of the device-to-memory transfer type,
 * or the destination address of the memory-to-device transfer type.
 *
 * About MT-safe, all the functions of the dmadev API implemented by a PMD are
 * lock-free functions which assume to not be invoked in parallel on different
 * logical cores to work on the same target dmadev object.
 * @note Different virtual DMA channels on the same dmadev *DO NOT* support
 * parallel invocation because these virtual DMA channels share the same
 * HW-DMA-channel.
