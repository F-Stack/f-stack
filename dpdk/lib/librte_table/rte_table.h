/**
 * @file
 * RTE Table
 *
 * This tool is part of the DPDK Packet Framework tool suite and provides
 * a standard interface to implement different types of lookup tables for data
 * plane processing.
 *
 * Virtually any search algorithm that can uniquely associate data to a lookup
 * key can be fitted under this lookup table abstraction. For the flow table
 * use-case, the lookup key is an n-tuple of packet fields that uniquely
 * identifies a traffic flow, while data represents actions and action
 * meta-data associated with the same traffic flow.
