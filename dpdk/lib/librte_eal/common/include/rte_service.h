 * The service functionality provided by this header allows a DPDK component
 * to indicate that it requires a function call in order for it to perform
 * its processing.
 *
 * An example usage of this functionality would be a component that registers
 * a service to perform a particular packet processing duty: for example the
 * eventdev software PMD. At startup the application requests all services
 * that have been registered, and the cores in the service-coremask run the
 * required services. The EAL removes these number of cores from the available
 * runtime cores, and dedicates them to performing service-core workloads. The
 * application has access to the remaining lcores as normal.
