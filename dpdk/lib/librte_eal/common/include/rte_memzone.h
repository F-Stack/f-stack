 * RTE Memzone
 *
 * The goal of the memzone allocator is to reserve contiguous
 * portions of physical memory. These zones are identified by a name.
 *
 * The memzone descriptors are shared by all partitions and are
 * located in a known place of physical memory. This zone is accessed
 * using rte_eal_get_configuration(). The lookup (by name) of a
 * memory zone can be done in any partition and returns the same
 * physical address.
 *
 * A reserved memory zone cannot be unreserved. The reservation shall
 * be done at initialization time only.
