 *
 * This API offers the ability to register options to the EAL command line and
 * map those options to functions that will be executed at the end of EAL
 * initialization. These options will be available as part of the EAL command
 * line of applications and are dynamically managed.
 *
 * This is used primarily by DPDK libraries offering command line options.
 * Currently, this API is limited to registering options without argument.
 *
 * The register API can be used to resolve circular dependency issues
 * between EAL and the library. The library uses EAL, but is also initialized
 * by EAL. Hence, EAL depends on the init function of the library. The API
 * introduced in rte_option allows us to register the library init with EAL
 * (passing a function pointer) and avoid the circular dependency.
