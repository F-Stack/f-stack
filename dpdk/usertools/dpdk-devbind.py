Usage:
------

     %(argv0)s [options] DEVICE1 DEVICE2 ....

where DEVICE1, DEVICE2 etc, are specified via PCI "domain:bus:slot.func" syntax
or "bus:slot.func" syntax. For devices bound to Linux kernel drivers, they may
also be referred to by Linux interface name e.g. eth0, eth1, em0, em1, etc.

Options:
    --help, --usage:
        Display usage information and quit

    -s, --status:
        Print the current status of all known network, crypto, event
        and mempool devices.
        For each device, it displays the PCI domain, bus, slot and function,
        along with a text description of the device. Depending upon whether the
        device is being used by a kernel driver, the igb_uio driver, or no
        driver, other relevant information will be displayed:
        * the Linux interface name e.g. if=eth0
        * the driver being used e.g. drv=igb_uio
        * any suitable drivers not currently using that device
            e.g. unused=igb_uio
        NOTE: if this flag is passed along with a bind/unbind option, the
        status display will always occur after the other operations have taken
        place.

    --status-dev:
        Print the status of given device group. Supported device groups are:
        "net", "crypto", "event", "mempool" and "compress"

    -b driver, --bind=driver:
        Select the driver to use or \"none\" to unbind the device

    -u, --unbind:
        Unbind a device (Equivalent to \"-b none\")

    --force:
        By default, network devices which are used by Linux - as indicated by
        having routes in the routing table - cannot be modified. Using the
        --force flag overrides this behavior, allowing active links to be
        forcibly unbound.
        WARNING: This can lead to loss of network connection and should be used
        with caution.

Examples:
---------

To display current device status:
        %(argv0)s --status

To display current network device status:
        %(argv0)s --status-dev net

To bind eth1 from the current driver and move to use igb_uio
        %(argv0)s --bind=igb_uio eth1

To unbind 0000:01:00.0 from using any driver
        %(argv0)s -u 0000:01:00.0

To bind 0000:02:00.0 and 0000:02:00.1 to the ixgbe kernel driver
        %(argv0)s -b ixgbe 02:00.0 02:00.1
