NXP DPAA2 CAAM (DPAA2_SEC)
==========================

The DPAA2_SEC PMD provides poll mode crypto driver support for NXP DPAA2 CAAM
hardware accelerator.

Architecture
------------

SEC is the SOC's security engine, which serves as NXP's latest cryptographic
acceleration and offloading hardware. It combines functions previously
implemented in separate modules to create a modular and scalable acceleration
and assurance engine. It also implements block encryption algorithms, stream
cipher algorithms, hashing algorithms, public key algorithms, run-time
integrity checking, and a hardware random number generator. SEC performs
higher-level cryptographic operations than previous NXP cryptographic
accelerators. This provides significant improvement to system level performance.

DPAA2_SEC is one of the hardware resource in DPAA2 Architecture. More information
on DPAA2 Architecture is described in :ref:`dpaa2_overview`.

DPAA2_SEC PMD is one of DPAA2 drivers which interacts with Management Complex (MC)
portal to access the hardware object - DPSECI. The MC provides access to create,
discover, connect, configure and destroy dpseci objects in DPAA2_SEC PMD.

DPAA2_SEC PMD also uses some of the other hardware resources like buffer pools,
queues, queue portals to store and to enqueue/dequeue data to the hardware SEC.

DPSECI objects are detected by PMD using a resource container called DPRC (like
in :ref:`dpaa2_overview`).

For example:

.. code-block:: console

    DPRC.1 (bus)
      |
      +--+--------+-------+-------+-------+---------+
         |        |       |       |       |         |
       DPMCP.1  DPIO.1  DPBP.1  DPNI.1  DPMAC.1  DPSECI.1
       DPMCP.2  DPIO.2          DPNI.2  DPMAC.2  DPSECI.2
       DPMCP.3

Implementation
--------------

SEC provides platform assurance by working with SecMon, which is a companion
logic block that tracks the security state of the SOC. SEC is programmed by
means of descriptors (not to be confused with frame descriptors (FDs)) that
indicate the operations to be performed and link to the message and
associated data. SEC incorporates two DMA engines to fetch the descriptors,
read the message data, and write the results of the operations. The DMA
engine provides a scatter/gather capability so that SEC can read and write
data scattered in memory. SEC may be configured by means of software for
dynamic changes in byte ordering. The default configuration for this version
of SEC is little-endian mode.

fits in the DPAA2 Bus model

Prerequisites
-------------

DPAA2_SEC driver has similar pre-requisites as described in :ref:`dpaa2_overview`.
The following dependencies are not part of DPDK and must be installed separately:

See :doc:`../platform/dpaa2` for setup information

Currently supported by DPDK:

- NXP SDK **18.09+**.
- MC Firmware version **10.10.0** and higher.
- Supported architectures:  **arm64 LE**.

- Follow the DPDK :ref:`Getting Started Guide for Linux <linux_gsg>` to setup the basic DPDK environment.

Pre-Installation Configuration
------------------------------

Config File Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Basic DPAA2 config file options are described in :ref:`dpaa2_overview`.
In addition to those, the following options can be modified in the ``config`` file
to enable DPAA2_SEC PMD.

Please note that enabling debugging options may affect system performance.

* ``CONFIG_RTE_LIBRTE_PMD_DPAA2_SEC`` (default ``n``)
  By default it is only enabled in defconfig_arm64-dpaa2-* config.
  Toggle compilation of the ``librte_pmd_dpaa2_sec`` driver.

Installations
-------------
To compile the DPAA2_SEC PMD for Linux arm64 gcc target, run the
following ``make`` command:

.. code-block:: console

   cd <DPDK-source-directory>
   make config T=arm64-dpaa2-linuxapp-gcc install

Enabling logs
-------------

For enabling logs, use the following EAL parameter:

.. code-block:: console

   ./your_crypto_application <EAL args> --log-level=pmd.crypto.dpaa2:<level>

Using ``crypto.dpaa2`` as log matching criteria, all Crypto PMD logs can be
enabled which are lower than logging ``level``.
