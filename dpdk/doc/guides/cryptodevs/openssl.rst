OpenSSL Crypto Poll Mode Driver
===============================

This code provides the initial implementation of the openssl poll mode
driver. All cryptography operations are using Openssl library crypto API.
Each algorithm uses EVP interface from openssl API - which is recommended
by Openssl maintainers.

For more details about openssl library please visit openssl webpage:
https://www.openssl.org/

Features
--------

OpenSSL PMD has support for:

Supported cipher algorithms:

* ``RTE_CRYPTO_CIPHER_3DES_CBC``
* ``RTE_CRYPTO_CIPHER_AES_CBC``
* ``RTE_CRYPTO_CIPHER_AES_CTR``
* ``RTE_CRYPTO_CIPHER_3DES_CTR``
* ``RTE_CRYPTO_CIPHER_DES_DOCSISBPI``

Supported authentication algorithms:

* ``RTE_CRYPTO_AUTH_AES_GMAC``
* ``RTE_CRYPTO_AUTH_MD5``
* ``RTE_CRYPTO_AUTH_SHA1``
* ``RTE_CRYPTO_AUTH_SHA224``
* ``RTE_CRYPTO_AUTH_SHA256``
* ``RTE_CRYPTO_AUTH_SHA384``
* ``RTE_CRYPTO_AUTH_SHA512``
* ``RTE_CRYPTO_AUTH_MD5_HMAC``
* ``RTE_CRYPTO_AUTH_SHA1_HMAC``
* ``RTE_CRYPTO_AUTH_SHA224_HMAC``
* ``RTE_CRYPTO_AUTH_SHA256_HMAC``
* ``RTE_CRYPTO_AUTH_SHA384_HMAC``
* ``RTE_CRYPTO_AUTH_SHA512_HMAC``

Supported AEAD algorithms:

* ``RTE_CRYPTO_AEAD_AES_GCM``
* ``RTE_CRYPTO_AEAD_AES_CCM``

Supported Asymmetric Crypto algorithms:

* ``RTE_CRYPTO_ASYM_XFORM_RSA``
* ``RTE_CRYPTO_ASYM_XFORM_DSA``
* ``RTE_CRYPTO_ASYM_XFORM_DH``
* ``RTE_CRYPTO_ASYM_XFORM_MODINV``
* ``RTE_CRYPTO_ASYM_XFORM_MODEX``


Installation
------------

To compile openssl PMD, it has to be enabled in the config/common_base file
and appropriate openssl packages have to be installed in the build environment.

The newest openssl library version is supported:

* 1.0.2h-fips  3 May 2016.

Older versions that were also verified:

* 1.0.1f 6 Jan 2014
* 1.0.1 14 Mar 2012

For Ubuntu 14.04 LTS these packages have to be installed in the build system:

.. code-block:: console

    sudo apt-get install openssl
    sudo apt-get install libc6-dev-i386 # for i686-native-linuxapp-gcc target

This code was also verified on Fedora 24.
This code has NOT been verified on FreeBSD yet.

Initialization
--------------

User can use app/test application to check how to use this pmd and to verify
crypto processing.

Test name is cryptodev_openssl_autotest.
For asymmetric crypto operations testing, run cryptodev_openssl_asym_autotest.

To verify real traffic l2fwd-crypto example can be used with this command:

.. code-block:: console

	sudo ./build/l2fwd-crypto -l 0-1 -n 4 --vdev "crypto_openssl"
	--vdev "crypto_openssl"-- -p 0x3 --chain CIPHER_HASH
	--cipher_op ENCRYPT --cipher_algo AES_CBC
	--cipher_key 00:01:02:03:04:05:06:07:08:09:0a:0b:0c:0d:0e:0f
	--iv 00:01:02:03:04:05:06:07:08:09:0a:0b:0c:0d:0e:ff
	--auth_op GENERATE --auth_algo SHA1_HMAC
	--auth_key 11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11
	:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11
	:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11:11

Limitations
-----------

* Maximum number of sessions is 2048.
* Chained mbufs are supported only for source mbuf (destination must be
  contiguous).
* Hash only is not supported for GCM and GMAC.
* Cipher only is not supported for GCM and GMAC.
