AESNI MB PMD selection over SNOW3G/ZUC/KASUMI PMDs
--------------------------------------------------

This PMD supports wireless cipher suite (SNOW3G, ZUC and KASUMI).
On Intel processors, it is recommended to use this PMD
instead of SNOW3G, ZUC and KASUMI PMDs, as it enables algorithm mixing
(e.g. cipher algorithm SNOW3G-UEA2 with authentication algorithm AES-CMAC-128)
and performance over IMIX (packet size mix) traffic is significantly higher.

AESNI MB PMD selection over CHACHA20-POLY1305 PMD
-------------------------------------------------

This PMD supports Chacha20-Poly1305 algorithm.
On Intel processors, it is recommended to use this PMD instead of CHACHA20-POLY1305 PMD,
as it delivers better performance on single segment buffers.
For multi-segment buffers, it is still recommended to use CHACHA20-POLY1305 PMD,
until the new SGL API is introduced in the AESNI MB PMD.

Installation
------------

To build DPDK with the AESNI_MB_PMD the user is required to download the multi-buffer
library from `here <https://github.com/01org/intel-ipsec-mb>`_
and compile it on their user system before building DPDK.
The latest version of the library supported by this PMD is v1.3, which
can be downloaded from `<https://github.com/01org/intel-ipsec-mb/archive/v1.3.zip>`_.

.. code-block:: console

    make
    make install

The library requires NASM to be built. Depending on the library version, it might
require a minimum NASM version (e.g. v0.54 requires at least NASM 2.14).

NASM is packaged for different OS. However, on some OS the version is too old,
so a manual installation is required. In that case, NASM can be downloaded from
`NASM website <https://www.nasm.us/pub/nasm/releasebuilds/?C=M;O=D>`_.
Once it is downloaded, extract it and follow these steps:

.. code-block:: console

    ./configure
    make
    make install

.. note::

   Compilation of the Multi-Buffer library is broken when GCC < 5.0, if library <= v0.53.
   If a lower GCC version than 5.0, the workaround proposed by the following link
   should be used: `<https://github.com/intel/intel-ipsec-mb/issues/40>`_.

As a reference, the following table shows a mapping between the past DPDK versions
and the Multi-Buffer library version supported by them:

   21.11+          1.0  - 1.3*
   ==============  ============================

\* Multi-buffer library 1.0 or newer only works for Meson but not Make build system.

Initialization
--------------

In order to enable this virtual crypto PMD, user must:

* Build the multi buffer library (explained in Installation section).

To use the PMD in an application, user must:

* Call rte_vdev_init("crypto_aesni_mb") within the application.

* Use --vdev="crypto_aesni_mb" in the EAL options, which will call rte_vdev_init() internally.

The following parameters (all optional) can be provided in the previous two calls:

* socket_id: Specify the socket where the memory for the device is going to be allocated
  (by default, socket_id will be the socket where the core that is creating the PMD is running on).

* max_nb_queue_pairs: Specify the maximum number of queue pairs in the device (8 by default).

* max_nb_sessions: Specify the maximum number of sessions that can be created (2048 by default).

Example:

.. code-block:: console

    ./dpdk-l2fwd-crypto -l 1 -n 4 --vdev="crypto_aesni_mb,socket_id=0,max_nb_sessions=128" \
    -- -p 1 --cdev SW --chain CIPHER_HASH --cipher_algo "aes-cbc" --auth_algo "sha1-hmac"

Extra notes
-----------

For AES Counter mode (AES-CTR), the library supports two different sizes for Initialization
Vector (IV):

* 12 bytes: used mainly for IPsec, as it requires 12 bytes from the user, which internally
  are appended the counter block (4 bytes), which is set to 1 for the first block
  (no padding required from the user)

* 16 bytes: when passing 16 bytes, the library will take them and use the last 4 bytes
  as the initial counter block for the first block.
