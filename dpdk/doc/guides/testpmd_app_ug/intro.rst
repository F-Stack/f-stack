Introduction
============

This document is a user guide for the ``testpmd`` example application that is shipped as part of the Data Plane Development Kit.

The ``testpmd`` application can be used to test the DPDK in a packet forwarding mode
and also to access NIC hardware features such as Flow Director.
It also serves as a example of how to build a more fully-featured application using the DPDK SDK.

The guide shows how to build and run the testpmd application and
how to configure the application from the command line and the run-time environment.
