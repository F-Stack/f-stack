Running the Application
=======================

EAL Command-line Options
------------------------

Please refer to  :doc:`../linux_gsg/linux_eal_parameters` or
:doc:`../freebsd_gsg/freebsd_eal_parameters` for a list of available EAL
command-line options.


Testpmd Command-line Options
----------------------------

The following are the command-line options for the testpmd applications.
They must be separated from the EAL options, shown in the previous section, with a ``--`` separator:

.. code-block:: console

    sudo ./testpmd -l 0-3 -n 4 -- -i --portmask=0x1 --nb-cores=2

The command line options are:

*   ``-i, --interactive``

    Run testpmd in interactive mode.
    In this mode, the testpmd starts with a prompt that can be used to start and stop forwarding,
    configure the application and display stats on the current packet processing session.
    See :ref:`testpmd_runtime` for more details.

    In non-interactive mode,
    the application starts with the configuration specified on the command-line and
    immediately enters forwarding mode.

*   ``-h, --help``

    Display a help message and quit.

*   ``-a, --auto-start``

    Start forwarding on initialization.

*   ``--tx-first``

    Start forwarding, after sending a burst of packets first.

.. Note::

   This flag should be only used in non-interactive mode.

*   ``--stats-period PERIOD``

    Display statistics every PERIOD seconds, if interactive mode is disabled.
    The default value is 0, which means that the statistics will not be displayed.

*   ``--nb-cores=N``

    Set the number of forwarding cores,
    where 1 <= N <= "number of cores" or ``CONFIG_RTE_MAX_LCORE`` from the configuration file.
    The default value is 1.

*   ``--nb-ports=N``

    Set the number of forwarding ports,
    where 1 <= N <= "number of ports" on the board or ``CONFIG_RTE_MAX_ETHPORTS`` from the configuration file.
    The default value is the number of ports on the board.

*   ``--coremask=0xXX``

    Set the hexadecimal bitmask of the cores running the packet forwarding test.
    The master lcore is reserved for command line parsing only and cannot be masked on for packet forwarding.

*   ``--portmask=0xXX``

    Set the hexadecimal bitmask of the ports used by the packet forwarding test.

*   ``--numa``

    Enable NUMA-aware allocation of RX/TX rings and of RX memory buffers
    (mbufs). [Default setting]

    where 0 <= N < number of sockets on the board.

    Set the maximum packet size to N bytes, where N >= 64. The default value is 1518.

*   ``--eth-peers-configfile=name``

    Use a configuration file containing the Ethernet addresses of the peer ports.
    The configuration file should contain the Ethernet addresses on separate lines::

       XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:01
       XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:02
       ...


*   ``--eth-peer=N,XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX``
