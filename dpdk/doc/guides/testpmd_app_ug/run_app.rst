Running the Application
=======================

EAL Command-line Options
------------------------

Please refer to :doc:`EAL parameters (Linux) <../linux_gsg/linux_eal_parameters>`
or :doc:`EAL parameters (FreeBSD) <../freebsd_gsg/freebsd_eal_parameters>` for
a list of available EAL command-line options.


Testpmd Command-line Options
----------------------------

The following are the command-line options for the testpmd applications.
They must be separated from the EAL options, shown in the previous section, with a ``--`` separator:

.. code-block:: console

    sudo ./dpdk-testpmd -l 0-3 -n 4 -- -i --portmask=0x1 --nb-cores=2

The command line options are:

*   ``-i, --interactive``

    Run testpmd in interactive mode.
    In this mode, the testpmd starts with a prompt that can be used to start and stop forwarding,
    configure the application and display stats on the current packet processing session.
    See :ref:`testpmd_runtime` for more details.

    In non-interactive mode,
    the application starts with the configuration specified on the command-line and
    immediately enters forwarding mode.

*   ``-h, --help``

    Display a help message and quit.

*   ``-a, --auto-start``

    Start forwarding on initialization.

*   ``--tx-first``

    Start forwarding, after sending a burst of packets first.

.. Note::

   This flag should be only used in non-interactive mode.

*   ``--stats-period PERIOD``

    Display statistics every PERIOD seconds, if interactive mode is disabled.
    The default value is 0, which means that the statistics will not be displayed.

*   ``--portlist=X``

      Set the forwarding ports based on the user input used by the packet forwarding test.
