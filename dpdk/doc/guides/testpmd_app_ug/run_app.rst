Running the Application
=======================

EAL Command-line Options
------------------------

Please refer to :doc:`EAL parameters (Linux) <../linux_gsg/linux_eal_parameters>`
or :doc:`EAL parameters (FreeBSD) <../freebsd_gsg/freebsd_eal_parameters>` for
a list of available EAL command-line options.


Testpmd Command-line Options
----------------------------

The following are the command-line options for the testpmd applications.
They must be separated from the EAL options, shown in the previous section, with a ``--`` separator:

.. code-block:: console

    sudo ./dpdk-testpmd -l 0-3 -n 4 -- -i --portmask=0x1 --nb-cores=2

The command line options are:

*   ``-i, --interactive``

    Run testpmd in interactive mode.
    In this mode, the testpmd starts with a prompt that can be used to start and stop forwarding,
    configure the application and display stats on the current packet processing session.
    See :ref:`testpmd_runtime` for more details.

    In non-interactive mode,
    the application starts with the configuration specified on the command-line and
    immediately enters forwarding mode.

*   ``-h, --help``

    Display a help message and quit.

*   ``-a, --auto-start``

    Start forwarding on initialization.

*   ``--tx-first``

    Start forwarding, after sending a burst of packets first.

.. Note::

   This flag should be only used in non-interactive mode.

*   ``--stats-period PERIOD``

    Display statistics every PERIOD seconds, if interactive mode is disabled.
    The default value is 0, which means that the statistics will not be displayed.

*   ``--display-xstats xstat_name1[,...]``

    Display comma-separated list of extended statistics every PERIOD seconds
    as specified in ``--stats-period`` or when used with interactive commands
    that show Rx/Tx statistics (i.e. 'show port stats').

*   ``--nb-cores=N``

    Set the number of forwarding cores,
    where 1 <= N <= "number of cores" or ``RTE_MAX_LCORE`` from the configuration file.
    The default value is 1.

*   ``--nb-ports=N``

    Set the number of forwarding ports,
    where 1 <= N <= "number of ports" on the board or ``RTE_MAX_ETHPORTS`` from the configuration file.
    The default value is the number of ports on the board.

*   ``--coremask=0xXX``

    Set the hexadecimal bitmask of the cores running the packet forwarding test.
    The main lcore is reserved for command line parsing only and cannot be masked on for packet forwarding.

*   ``--portmask=0xXX``

    Set the hexadecimal bitmask of the ports used by the packet forwarding test.

*   ``--portlist=X``

      Set the forwarding ports based on the user input used by the packet forwarding test.
      '-' denotes a range of ports to set including the two specified port IDs
      ',' separates multiple port values.
      Possible examples like --portlist=0,1 or --portlist=0-2 or --portlist=0,1-2 etc

*   ``--numa``

    Set the socket from which all memory is allocated in NUMA mode,
    where 0 <= N < number of sockets on the board.

*   ``--mbuf-size=N[,N1[,...Nn]``

    Set the data size of the mbufs used to N bytes, where N < 65536.
    The default value is 2048. If multiple mbuf-size values are specified the
    extra memory pools will be created for allocating mbufs to receive packets
    with buffer splitting features.

*   ``--total-num-mbufs=N``

    Set the number of mbufs to be allocated in the mbuf pools, where N > 1024.

    reserved for benchmarking (RFC 5735).

*   ``--tx-udp=SRC[,DST]``

    Set the source and destination UDP port number for transmit test only test.
    The default port is the port 9 which is defined for the discard protocol
    (RFC 863).

    Disable hardware CRC stripping.

*   ``--enable-lro``

    Enable large receive offload.

    In ``chained`` mode, the forwarding is to the next available port in the port mask, for example: (0,1), (1,2), (2,0).

    The ordering of the ports can be changed using the portlist testpmd runtime function.

    In ``loop`` mode, ingress traffic is simply transmitted back on the same interface.

Testpmd Multi-Process Command-line Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following are the command-line options for testpmd multi-process support:

*   primary process:

.. code-block:: console

    sudo ./dpdk-testpmd -a xxx --proc-type=auto -l 0-1 -- -i --rxq=4 --txq=4 \
        --num-procs=2 --proc-id=0

*   secondary process:

.. code-block:: console

    sudo ./dpdk-testpmd -a xxx --proc-type=auto -l 2-3 -- -i --rxq=4 --txq=4 \
        --num-procs=2 --proc-id=1

The command line options are:

*   ``--num-procs=N``

    The number of processes which will be used.

*   ``--proc-id=ID``

    The ID of the current process (ID < num-procs). ID should be different in
    primary process and secondary process, which starts from '0'.

Calculation rule for queue:
All queues are allocated to different processes based on ``proc_num`` and
``proc_id``.
Calculation rule for the testpmd to allocate queues to each process:
*   start(queue start id) = proc_id * nb_q / num_procs；

*   end(queue end id) = start + nb_q / num_procs；

For example, if testpmd is configured to have 4 Tx and Rx queues,
queues 0 and 1 will be used by the primary process and
queues 2 and 3 will be used by the secondary process.

The number of queues should be a multiple of the number of processes. If not,
redundant queues will exist after queues are allocated to processes. If RSS
is enabled, packet loss occurs when traffic is sent to all processes at the same
time. Some traffic goes to redundant queues and cannot be forwarded.

All the dev ops is supported in primary process. While secondary process is
not permitted to allocate or release shared memory, so some ops are not supported
as follows:

- ``dev_configure``
- ``dev_start``
- ``dev_stop``
- ``dev_reset``
- ``rx_queue_setup``
- ``tx_queue_setup``
- ``rx_queue_release``
- ``tx_queue_release``

So, any command from testpmd which calls those APIs will not be supported in
secondary process, like:

.. code-block:: console

    port config all rxq|txq|rxd|txd <value>
    port config <port_id> rx_offload xxx on/off
    port config <port_id> tx_offload xxx on/off

etc.

When secondary is running, port in primary is not permitted to be stopped.
Reconfigure operation is only valid in primary.

Stats is supported, stats will not change when one quits and starts, as they
share the same buffer to store the stats. Flow rules are maintained in process
level: primary and secondary has its own flow list (but one flow list in HW).
The two can see all the queues, so setting the flow rules for the other is OK.
But in the testpmd primary process receiving or transmitting packets from the
queue allocated for secondary process is not permitted, and same for secondary
process.

Flow API and RSS are supported.
