Testpmd Runtime Functions
=========================

Where the testpmd application is started in interactive mode, (``-i|--interactive``),
it displays a prompt that can be used to start and stop forwarding,
configure the application, display statistics (including the extended NIC
statistics aka xstats) , set the Flow Director and other tasks::

   testpmd>

The testpmd prompt has some, limited, readline support.
Common bash command-line functions such as ``Ctrl+a`` and ``Ctrl+e`` to go to the start and end of the prompt line are supported
as well as access to the command history via the up-arrow.

There is also support for tab completion.
If you type a partial command and hit ``<TAB>`` you get a list of the available completions:

.. code-block:: console

   testpmd> show port <TAB>

       info [Mul-choice STRING]: show|clear port info|stats|xstats|fdir|stat_qmap|dcb_tc|cap X
       info [Mul-choice STRING]: show|clear port info|stats|xstats|fdir|stat_qmap|dcb_tc|cap all
       stats [Mul-choice STRING]: show|clear port info|stats|xstats|fdir|stat_qmap|dcb_tc|cap X
       stats [Mul-choice STRING]: show|clear port info|stats|xstats|fdir|stat_qmap|dcb_tc|cap all
       ...


.. note::

   Some examples in this document are too long to fit on one line are are shown wrapped at `"\\"` for display purposes::

      testpmd> set flow_ctrl rx (on|off) tx (on|off) (high_water) (low_water) \
               (pause_time) (send_xon) (port_id)

In the real ``testpmd>`` prompt these commands should be on a single line.

Help Functions
--------------

The testpmd has on-line help for the functions that are available at runtime.
These are divided into sections and can be accessed using help, help section or help all:

.. code-block:: console

   testpmd> help

       help control    : Start and stop forwarding.
       help display    : Displaying port, stats and config information.
       help config     : Configuration information.
       help ports      : Configuring ports.
       help registers  : Reading and setting port registers.
       help filters    : Filters configuration help.
       help all        : All of the above sections.


Command File Functions
----------------------

To facilitate loading large number of commands or to avoid cutting and pasting where not
practical or possible testpmd supports alternative methods for executing commands.

* If started with the ``--cmdline-file=FILENAME`` command line argument testpmd
  will execute all CLI commands contained within the file immediately before
  starting packet forwarding or entering interactive mode.

.. code-block:: console

   ./testpmd -n4 -r2 ... -- -i --cmdline-file=/home/ubuntu/flow-create-commands.txt
   Interactive-mode selected
   CLI commands to be read from /home/ubuntu/flow-create-commands.txt
   Configuring Port 0 (socket 0)
   Port 0: 7C:FE:90:CB:74:CE
   Configuring Port 1 (socket 0)
   Port 1: 7C:FE:90:CB:74:CA
   Checking link statuses...
   Port 0 Link Up - speed 10000 Mbps - full-duplex
   Port 1 Link Up - speed 10000 Mbps - full-duplex
   Done
   Flow rule #0 created
   Flow rule #1 created
   ...
   ...
   Flow rule #498 created
   Flow rule #499 created
   Read all CLI commands from /home/ubuntu/flow-create-commands.txt
   testpmd>


* At run-time additional commands can be loaded in bulk by invoking the ``load FILENAME``
  command.

.. code-block:: console

   testpmd> load /home/ubuntu/flow-create-commands.txt
   Flow rule #0 created
   Flow rule #1 created
   ...
   ...
   Flow rule #498 created
   Flow rule #499 created
   Read all CLI commands from /home/ubuntu/flow-create-commands.txt
   testpmd>


In all cases output from any included command will be displayed as standard output.
Execution will continue until the end of the file is reached regardless of
whether any errors occur.  The end user must examine the output to determine if
any failures occurred.

   testpmd> show port (port_id) rss reta (size) (mask0, mask1...)

size is used to indicate the hardware supported reta size

show port rss-hash
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   testpmd> show port (port_id) rss-hash ipv4|ipv4-frag|ipv4-tcp|ipv4-udp|ipv4-sctp|ipv4-other|ipv6|ipv6-frag|ipv6-tcp|ipv6-udp|ipv6-sctp|ipv6-other|l2-payload|ipv6-ex|ipv6-tcp-ex|ipv6-udp-ex [key]

clear port
~~~~~~~~~~

Clear the port statistics for a given port or for all ports::

   testpmd> clear port (info|stats|xstats|fdir|stat_qmap) (port_id|all)

For example::

   testpmd> clear port stats all

show (rxq|txq)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Display information for a given port's RX/TX queue::

   testpmd> show (rxq|txq) info (port_id) (queue_id)

show config
~~~~~~~~~~~

Displays the configuration of the application.
The configuration comes from the command-line, the runtime or the application defaults::

   testpmd> show config (rxtx|cores|fwd|txpkts)

The available information categories are:

* ``rxtx``: RX/TX configuration items.

* ``cores``: List of forwarding cores.

* ``fwd``: Packet forwarding configuration.

* ``txpkts``: Packets to TX configuration.

For example:

.. code-block:: console

   testpmd> show config rxtx

   io packet forwarding - CRC stripping disabled - packets/burst=16
   nb forwarding cores=2 - nb forwarding ports=1
   RX queues=1 - RX desc=128 - RX free threshold=0
   RX threshold registers: pthresh=8 hthresh=8 wthresh=4
   TX queues=1 - TX desc=512 - TX free threshold=0
   TX threshold registers: pthresh=36 hthresh=0 wthresh=0
   TX RS bit threshold=0 - TXQ flags=0x0

set fwd
~~~~~~~

Set the packet forwarding mode::

   testpmd> set fwd (io|mac|macswap|flowgen| \
                     rxonly|txonly|csum|icmpecho) (""|retry)

``retry`` can be specified for forwarding engines except ``rx_only``.

The available information categories are:

* ``io``: Forwards packets "as-is" in I/O mode.
  This is the fastest possible forwarding operation as it does not access packets data.
  This is the default mode.

* ``mac``: Changes the source and the destination Ethernet addresses of packets before forwarding them.
  Default application behaviour is to set source Ethernet address to that of the transmitting interface, and destination
  address to a dummy value (set during init). The user may specify a target destination Ethernet address via the 'eth-peer' or
  'eth-peer-configfile' command-line options. It is not currently possible to specify a specific source Ethernet address.

* ``macswap``: MAC swap forwarding mode.
  Swaps the source and the destination Ethernet addresses of packets before forwarding them.

* ``flowgen``: Multi-flow generation mode.
  Originates a number of flows (with varying destination IP addresses), and terminate receive traffic.

* ``rxonly``: Receives packets but doesn't transmit them.

* ``txonly``: Generates and transmits packets without receiving any.

* ``csum``: Changes the checksum field with hardware or software methods depending on the offload flags on the packet.

* ``icmpecho``: Receives a burst of packets, lookup for IMCP echo requests and, if any, send back ICMP echo replies.

* ``ieee1588``: Demonstrate L2 IEEE1588 V2 PTP timestamping for RX and TX. Requires ``CONFIG_RTE_LIBRTE_IEEE1588=y``.

* ``tm``: Traffic Management forwarding mode
  Demonstrates the use of ethdev traffic management APIs and softnic PMD for
  QoS traffic management. In this mode, 5-level hierarchical QoS scheduler is
  available as an default option that can be enabled through CLI. The user can
  also modify the default hierarchy or specify the new hierarchy through CLI for
  implementing QoS scheduler.  Requires ``CONFIG_RTE_LIBRTE_PMD_SOFTNIC=y`` ``CONFIG_RTE_LIBRTE_SCHED=y``.

Note: TX timestamping is only available in the "Full Featured" TX path. To force ``testpmd`` into this mode set ``--txqflags=0``.

Example::

   testpmd> set fwd rxonly

   Set rxonly packet forwarding mode


read rxd
~~~~~~~~

Display an RX descriptor for a port RX queue::

   testpmd> read rxd (port_id) (queue_id) (rxd_id)

For example::

   testpmd> read rxd 0 0 4
        0x0000000B - 0x001D0180 / 0x0000000B - 0x001D0180

read txd
~~~~~~~~

Display a TX descriptor for a port TX queue::

   testpmd> read txd (port_id) (queue_id) (txd_id)

For example::

   testpmd> read txd 0 0 4
        0x00000001 - 0x24C3C440 / 0x000F0000 - 0x2330003C

   testpmd> show port (port_id) pctype mapping


Configuration Functions
-----------------------

The testpmd application can be configured from the runtime as well as from the command-line.

This section details the available configuration functions that are available.

.. note::

   Configuration changes only become active when forwarding is started/restarted.

set default
~~~~~~~~~~~

Reset forwarding to the default configuration::

   testpmd> set default

set verbose
~~~~~~~~~~~

Set the debug verbosity level::

   testpmd> set verbose (level)

Currently the only available levels are 0 (silent except for error) and 1 (fully verbose).

set nbport
~~~~~~~~~~

Set the number of ports used by the application:

set nbport (num)

This is equivalent to the ``--nb-ports`` command-line option.

set nbcore
~~~~~~~~~~

Set the number of cores used by the application::

   testpmd> set nbcore (num)

This is equivalent to the ``--nb-cores`` command-line option.

.. note::

   The number of cores used must not be greater than number of ports used multiplied by the number of queues per port.

set coremask
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Set the forwarding cores hexadecimal mask::

   testpmd> set coremask (mask)

This is equivalent to the ``--coremask`` command-line option.

.. note::

   The master lcore is reserved for command line parsing only and cannot be masked on for packet forwarding.

set portmask
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Set the forwarding ports hexadecimal mask::

   testpmd> set portmask (mask)

This is equivalent to the ``--portmask`` command-line option.

set burst
~~~~~~~~~

Set number of packets per burst::

   testpmd> set burst (num)

This is equivalent to the ``--burst command-line`` option.

When retry is enabled, the transmit delay time and number of retries can also be set::

   testpmd> set burst tx delay (microseconds) retry (num)

set txpkts
~~~~~~~~~~

Set the length of each segment of the TX-ONLY packets or length of packet for FLOWGEN mode::

   testpmd> set txpkts (x[,y]*)

Where x[,y]* represents a CSV list of values, without white space.

set txsplit
~~~~~~~~~~~

Set the split policy for the TX packets, applicable for TX-ONLY and CSUM forwarding modes::

   testpmd> set txsplit (off|on|rand)

Where:

* ``off`` disable packet copy & split for CSUM mode.

* ``on`` split outgoing packet into multiple segments. Size of each segment
  and number of segments per packet is determined by ``set txpkts`` command
  (see above).

* ``rand`` same as 'on', but number of segments per each packet is a random value between 1 and total number of segments.

set corelist
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Set the list of forwarding cores::

   testpmd> set corelist (x[,y]*)

For example, to change the forwarding cores:

.. code-block:: console

   testpmd> set corelist 3,1
   testpmd> show config fwd

   io packet forwarding - ports=2 - cores=2 - streams=2 - NUMA support disabled
   Logical Core 3 (socket 0) forwards packets on 1 streams:
   RX P=0/Q=0 (socket 0) -> TX P=1/Q=0 (socket 0) peer=02:00:00:00:00:01
   Logical Core 1 (socket 0) forwards packets on 1 streams:
   RX P=1/Q=0 (socket 0) -> TX P=0/Q=0 (socket 0) peer=02:00:00:00:00:00

.. note::

   The cores are used in the same order as specified on the command line.

set portlist
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Set the list of forwarding ports::

   testpmd> set portlist (x[,y]*)

For example, to change the port forwarding:

.. code-block:: console

   testpmd> set portlist 0,2,1,3
   testpmd> show config fwd

   io packet forwarding - ports=4 - cores=1 - streams=4
   Logical Core 3 (socket 0) forwards packets on 4 streams:
   RX P=0/Q=0 (socket 0) -> TX P=2/Q=0 (socket 0) peer=02:00:00:00:00:01
   RX P=2/Q=0 (socket 0) -> TX P=0/Q=0 (socket 0) peer=02:00:00:00:00:00
   RX P=1/Q=0 (socket 0) -> TX P=3/Q=0 (socket 0) peer=02:00:00:00:00:03

  it is for all configuration about queue region from up layer,
  at first will only keep in DPDK softwarestored in driver,
  only after "flush on", it commit all configuration to HW.
  "off" is just clean all configuration about queue region just now,
  and restore all to DPDK i40e driver default config when start up.

Show all queue region related configuration info on a port::

   testpmd> show port (port_id) queue-region

.. note::

  Queue region only support on PF by now, so these command is
  only for configuration of queue region on PF port.

csum parse-tunnel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Define how tunneled packets should be handled by the csum forward
engine::

   testpmd> csum parse-tunnel (on|off) (tx_port_id)

If enabled, the csum forward engine will try to recognize supported
tunnel headers (vxlan, gre, ipip).

If disabled, treat tunnel packets as non-tunneled packets (a inner
header is handled as a packet payload).

.. note::

   The port argument is the TX port like in the ``csum set`` command.

Example:

Consider a packet in packet like the following::

   eth_out/ipv4_out/udp_out/vxlan/eth_in/ipv4_in/tcp_in

* If parse-tunnel is enabled, the ``ip|udp|tcp|sctp`` parameters of ``csum set``
  command relate to the inner headers (here ``ipv4_in`` and ``tcp_in``), and the
  ``outer-ip parameter`` relates to the outer headers (here ``ipv4_out``).

* If parse-tunnel is disabled, the ``ip|udp|tcp|sctp`` parameters of ``csum  set``
   command relate to the outer headers, here ``ipv4_out`` and ``udp_out``.

csum show
~~~~~~~~~

Display tx checksum offload configuration::

   testpmd> csum show (port_id)

tso set
~~~~~~~

Enable TCP Segmentation Offload (TSO) in the ``csum`` forwarding engine::

   testpmd> tso set (segsize) (port_id)

.. note::

   Check the NIC datasheet for hardware limits.

tso show
~~~~~~~~

Display the status of TCP Segmentation Offload::

   testpmd> tso show (port_id)

set port - gro
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Enable or disable GRO in ``csum`` forwarding engine::

   testpmd> set port <port_id> gro on|off

If enabled, the csum forwarding engine will perform GRO on the TCP/IPv4
packets received from the given port.

If disabled, packets received from the given port won't be performed
GRO. By default, GRO is disabled for all ports.

.. note::

   When enable GRO for a port, TCP/IPv4 packets received from the port
   will be performed GRO. After GRO, all merged packets have bad
   checksums, since the GRO library doesn't re-calculate checksums for
   the merged packets. Therefore, if users want the merged packets to
   have correct checksums, please select HW IP checksum calculation and
   HW TCP checksum calculation for the port which the merged packets are
   transmitted to.

show port - gro
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Display GRO configuration for a given port::

   testpmd> show port <port_id> gro

set gro flush
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Set the cycle to flush the GROed packets from reassembly tables::

   testpmd> set gro flush <cycles>

When enable GRO, the csum forwarding engine performs GRO on received
packets, and the GROed packets are stored in reassembly tables. Users
can use this command to determine when the GROed packets are flushed
from the reassembly tables.

The ``cycles`` is measured in GRO operation times. The csum forwarding
engine flushes the GROed packets from the tables every ``cycles`` GRO
operations.

By default, the value of ``cycles`` is 1, which means flush GROed packets
from the reassembly tables as soon as one GRO operation finishes. The value
of ``cycles`` should be in the range of 1 to ``GRO_MAX_FLUSH_CYCLES``.

Please note that the large value of ``cycles`` may cause the poor TCP/IP
stack performance. Because the GROed packets are delayed to arrive the
stack, thus causing more duplicated ACKs and TCP retransmissions.

set port - gso
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Toggle per-port GSO support in ``csum`` forwarding engine::

   testpmd> set port <port_id> gso on|off

If enabled, the csum forwarding engine will perform GSO on supported IPv4
packets, transmitted on the given port.

If disabled, packets transmitted on the given port will not undergo GSO.
By default, GSO is disabled for all ports.

.. note::

   When GSO is enabled on a port, supported IPv4 packets transmitted on that
   port undergo GSO. Afterwards, the segmented packets are represented by
   multi-segment mbufs; however, the csum forwarding engine doesn't calculation
   of checksums for GSO'd segments in SW. As a result, if users want correct
   checksums in GSO segments, they should enable HW checksum calculation for
   GSO-enabled ports.

   For example, HW checksum calculation for VxLAN GSO'd packets may be enabled
   by setting the following options in the csum forwarding engine:

   testpmd> csum set outer_ip hw <port_id>

   testpmd> csum set ip hw <port_id>

   testpmd> csum set tcp hw <port_id>

Port Functions
--------------

The following sections show functions for configuring ports.

.. note::

   Port configuration changes only become active when forwarding is started/restarted.

port attach
~~~~~~~~~~~

Attach a port specified by pci address or virtual device args::

   testpmd> port attach (identifier)

To attach a new pci device, the device should be recognized by kernel first.
Then it should be moved under DPDK management.
Finally the port can be attached to testpmd.

For example, to move a pci device using ixgbe under DPDK management:

.. code-block:: console

   # Check the status of the available devices.
   ./usertools/dpdk-devbind.py --status

   Network devices using DPDK-compatible driver
   ============================================
   <none>

   Network devices using kernel driver
   ===================================
   0000:0a:00.0 '82599ES 10-Gigabit' if=eth2 drv=ixgbe unused=


   # Bind the device to igb_uio.
   sudo ./usertools/dpdk-devbind.py -b igb_uio 0000:0a:00.0


   # Recheck the status of the devices.
   ./usertools/dpdk-devbind.py --status
   Network devices using DPDK-compatible driver
   ============================================
   0000:0a:00.0 '82599ES 10-Gigabit' drv=igb_uio unused=

To attach a port created by virtual device, above steps are not needed.

For example, to attach a port whose pci address is 0000:0a:00.0.

.. code-block:: console

   testpmd> port attach 0000:0a:00.0
   Attaching a new port...
   EAL: PCI device 0000:0a:00.0 on NUMA socket -1
   EAL:   probe driver: 8086:10fb rte_ixgbe_pmd
   EAL:   PCI memory mapped at 0x7f83bfa00000
   EAL:   PCI memory mapped at 0x7f83bfa80000
   PMD: eth_ixgbe_dev_init(): MAC: 2, PHY: 18, SFP+: 5
   PMD: eth_ixgbe_dev_init(): port 0 vendorID=0x8086 deviceID=0x10fb
   Port 0 is attached. Now total ports is 1
   Done

For example, to attach a port created by pcap PMD.

.. code-block:: console

   testpmd> port attach net_pcap0
   Attaching a new port...
   PMD: Initializing pmd_pcap for net_pcap0
   PMD: Creating pcap-backed ethdev on numa socket 0
   Port 0 is attached. Now total ports is 1
   Done

In this case, identifier is ``net_pcap0``.
This identifier format is the same as ``--vdev`` format of DPDK applications.

For example, to re-attach a bonded port which has been previously detached,
the mode and slave parameters must be given.

.. code-block:: console

   testpmd> port attach net_bond_0,mode=0,slave=1
   Attaching a new port...
   EAL: Initializing pmd_bond for net_bond_0
   EAL: Create bonded device net_bond_0 on port 0 in mode 0 on socket 0.
   Port 0 is attached. Now total ports is 1
   Done


port detach
~~~~~~~~~~~

Detach a specific port::

   testpmd> port detach (port_id)

Before detaching a port, the port should be stopped and closed.

For example, to detach a pci device port 0.

.. code-block:: console

   testpmd> port stop 0
   Stopping ports...
   Done
   testpmd> port close 0
   Closing ports...
   Done

   testpmd> port detach 0
   Detaching a port...
   EAL: PCI device 0000:0a:00.0 on NUMA socket -1
   EAL:   remove driver: 8086:10fb rte_ixgbe_pmd
   EAL:   PCI memory unmapped at 0x7f83bfa00000
   EAL:   PCI memory unmapped at 0x7f83bfa80000
   Done


For example, to detach a virtual device port 0.

.. code-block:: console

   testpmd> port stop 0
   Stopping ports...
   Done
   testpmd> port close 0
   Closing ports...
   Done

   testpmd> port detach 0
   Detaching a port...
   PMD: Closing pcap ethdev on numa socket 0
   Port 'net_pcap0' is detached. Now total ports is 0
   Done

To remove a pci device completely from the system, first detach the port from testpmd.
Then the device should be moved under kernel management.
Finally the device can be removed using kernel pci hotplug functionality.

For example, to move a pci device under kernel management:

.. code-block:: console

   sudo ./usertools/dpdk-devbind.py -b ixgbe 0000:0a:00.0

   ./usertools/dpdk-devbind.py --status

   Network devices using DPDK-compatible driver
   ============================================
   <none>

   Network devices using kernel driver
   ===================================
   0000:0a:00.0 '82599ES 10-Gigabit' if=eth2 drv=ixgbe unused=igb_uio

Link Bonding Functions
----------------------

The Link Bonding functions make it possible to dynamically create and
manage link bonding devices from within testpmd interactive prompt.

create bonded device
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Create a new bonding device::

   testpmd> create bonded device (mode) (socket)

For example, to create a bonded device in mode 1 on socket 0::

   testpmd> create bonded 1 0
   created new bonded device (port X)

add bonding slave
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Adds Ethernet device to a Link Bonding device::

   testpmd> add bonding slave (slave id) (port id)

For example, to add Ethernet device (port 6) to a Link Bonding device (port 10)::

   testpmd> add bonding slave 6 10


remove bonding slave
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Removes an Ethernet slave device from a Link Bonding device::

   testpmd> remove bonding slave (slave id) (port id)

For example, to remove Ethernet slave device (port 6) to a Link Bonding device (port 10)::

   testpmd> remove bonding slave 6 10

set bonding mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Set the Link Bonding mode of a Link Bonding device::

   testpmd> set bonding mode (value) (port id)

For example, to set the bonding mode of a Link Bonding device (port 10) to broadcast (mode 3)::

   testpmd> set bonding mode 3 10

set bonding primary
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Set an Ethernet slave device as the primary device on a Link Bonding device::

   testpmd> set bonding primary (slave id) (port id)

For example, to set the Ethernet slave device (port 6) as the primary port of a Link Bonding device (port 10)::

set bonding mon_period
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Set the link status monitoring polling period in milliseconds for a bonding device.

This adds support for PMD slave devices which do not support link status interrupts.
When the mon_period is set to a value greater than 0 then all PMD's which do not support
link status ISR will be queried every polling interval to check if their link status has changed::

   testpmd> set bonding mon_period (port_id) (value)

For example, to set the link status monitoring polling period of bonded device (port 5) to 150ms::

   testpmd> set bonding mon_period 5 150

        Primary: [3]


Register Functions
------------------

The Register Functions can be used to read from and write to registers on the network card referenced by a port number.
This is mainly useful for debugging purposes.
Reference should be made to the appropriate datasheet for the network card for details on the register addresses
and fields that can be accessed.

   port 0 PCI register at offset 0xEE00: bit 0=1

write reg
~~~~~~~~~

Set the value of a port register::

   testpmd> write reg (port_id) (address) (value)

For example, to clear a register::

.. _testpmd_flow_director:

flow_director_filter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Flow Director works in receive mode to identify specific flows or sets of flows and route them to specific queues.

Four types of filtering are supported which are referred to as Perfect Match, Signature, Perfect-mac-vlan and
Perfect-tunnel filters, the match mode is set by the ``--pkt-filter-mode`` command-line parameter:

* Perfect match filters.
  The hardware checks a match between the masked fields of the received packets and the programmed filters.
  The masked fields are for IP flow.

* Signature filters.
  The hardware checks a match between a hash-based signature of the masked fields of the received packet.

* Perfect-mac-vlan match filters.
  The hardware checks a match between the masked fields of the received packets and the programmed filters.
  The masked fields are for MAC VLAN flow.

* Perfect-tunnel match filters.
  The hardware checks a match between the masked fields of the received packets and the programmed filters.
  The masked fields are for tunnel flow.

The Flow Director filters can match the different fields for different type of packet: flow type, specific input set
per flow type and the flexible payload.

The Flow Director can also mask out parts of all of these fields so that filters
are only applied to certain fields or parts of the fields.

Different NICs may have different capabilities, command show port fdir (port_id) can be used to acquire the information.

.. _testpmd_rte_flow:

Flow rules management
---------------------

Control of the generic flow API (*rte_flow*) is fully exposed through the
``flow`` command (validation, creation, destruction, queries and operation
modes).

Considering *rte_flow* overlaps with all `Filter Functions`_, using both
features simultaneously may cause undefined side-effects and is therefore
not recommended.

``flow`` syntax
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Because the ``flow`` command uses dynamic tokens to handle the large number
of possible flow rules combinations, its behavior differs slightly from
other commands, in particular:

- Pressing *?* or the *<tab>* key displays contextual help for the current
  token, not that of the entire command.

- Optional and repeated parameters are supported (provided they are listed
  in the contextual help).

The first parameter stands for the operation mode. Possible operations and
their general syntax are described below. They are covered in detail in the
following sections.

- Check whether a flow rule can be created::

   flow validate {port_id}
       [group {group_id}] [priority {level}] [ingress] [egress]
       pattern {item} [/ {item} [...]] / end
       actions {action} [/ {action} [...]] / end

- Create a flow rule::

   flow create {port_id}
       [group {group_id}] [priority {level}] [ingress] [egress]
       pattern {item} [/ {item} [...]] / end
       actions {action} [/ {action} [...]] / end

- Destroy specific flow rules::

   flow destroy {port_id} rule {rule_id} [...]

- Destroy all flow rules::

   flow flush {port_id}

- Query an existing flow rule::

   flow query {port_id} {rule_id} {action}

- List existing flow rules sorted by priority, filtered by group
  identifiers::

   flow list {port_id} [group {group_id}] [...]

- Restrict ingress traffic to the defined flow rules::

   flow isolate {port_id} {boolean}

Validating flow rules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``flow validate`` reports whether a flow rule would be accepted by the
underlying device in its current state but stops short of creating it. It is
bound to ``rte_flow_validate()``::

   flow validate {port_id}
      [group {group_id}] [priority {level}] [ingress] [egress]
      pattern {item} [/ {item} [...]] / end
      actions {action} [/ {action} [...]] / end

If successful, it will show::

   Flow rule validated

Otherwise it will show an error message of the form::

   Caught error type [...] ([...]): [...]

This command uses the same parameters as ``flow create``, their format is
described in `Creating flow rules`_.

Check whether redirecting any Ethernet packet received on port 0 to RX queue
index 6 is supported::

   testpmd> flow validate 0 ingress pattern eth / end
      actions queue index 6 / end
   Flow rule validated
   testpmd>

Port 0 does not support TCPv6 rules::

   testpmd> flow validate 0 ingress pattern eth / ipv6 / tcp / end
      actions drop / end
   Caught error type 9 (specific pattern item): Invalid argument
   testpmd>

Creating flow rules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``flow create`` validates and creates the specified flow rule. It is bound
to ``rte_flow_create()``::

   flow create {port_id}
      [group {group_id}] [priority {level}] [ingress] [egress]
      pattern {item} [/ {item} [...]] / end
      actions {action} [/ {action} [...]] / end

If successful, it will return a flow rule ID usable with other commands::

   Flow rule #[...] created

Otherwise it will show an error message of the form::

   Caught error type [...] ([...]): [...]

Parameters describe in the following order:

- Attributes (*group*, *priority*, *ingress*, *egress* tokens).
- A matching pattern, starting with the *pattern* token and terminated by an
  *end* pattern item.
- Actions, starting with the *actions* token and terminated by an *end*
  action.

These translate directly to *rte_flow* objects provided as-is to the
underlying functions.

The shortest valid definition only comprises mandatory tokens::

   testpmd> flow create 0 pattern end actions end

Note that PMDs may refuse rules that essentially do nothing such as this
one.

**All unspecified object values are automatically initialized to 0.**

Attributes
^^^^^^^^^^

These tokens affect flow rule attributes (``struct rte_flow_attr``) and are
specified before the ``pattern`` token.

- ``group {group id}``: priority group.
- ``priority {level}``: priority level within group.
- ``ingress``: rule applies to ingress traffic.
- ``egress``: rule applies to egress traffic.

Each instance of an attribute specified several times overrides the previous
value as shown below (group 4 is used)::

   testpmd> flow create 0 group 42 group 24 group 4 [...]

Note that once enabled, ``ingress`` and ``egress`` cannot be disabled.

While not specifying a direction is an error, some rules may allow both
simultaneously.

Most rules affect RX therefore contain the ``ingress`` token::

   testpmd> flow create 0 ingress pattern [...]

Matching pattern
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A matching pattern starts after the ``pattern`` token. It is made of pattern
items and is terminated by a mandatory ``end`` item.

Items are named after their type (*RTE_FLOW_ITEM_TYPE_* from ``enum
rte_flow_item_type``).

The ``/`` token is used as a separator between pattern items as shown
below::

   testpmd> flow create 0 ingress pattern eth / ipv4 / udp / end [...]

Note that protocol items like these must be stacked from lowest to highest
layer to make sense. For instance, the following rule is either invalid or
unlikely to match any packet::

   testpmd> flow create 0 ingress pattern eth / udp / ipv4 / end [...]

More information on these restrictions can be found in the *rte_flow*
documentation.

Several items support additional specification structures, for example
``ipv4`` allows specifying source and destination addresses as follows::

   testpmd> flow create 0 ingress pattern eth / ipv4 src is 10.1.1.1
      dst is 10.2.0.0 / end [...]

This rule matches all IPv4 traffic with the specified properties.

In this example, ``src`` and ``dst`` are field names of the underlying
``struct rte_flow_item_ipv4`` object. All item properties can be specified
in a similar fashion.

The ``is`` token means that the subsequent value must be matched exactly,
and assigns ``spec`` and ``mask`` fields in ``struct rte_flow_item``
accordingly. Possible assignment tokens are:

- ``is``: match value perfectly (with full bit-mask).
- ``spec``: match value according to configured bit-mask.
- ``last``: specify upper bound to establish a range.
- ``mask``: specify bit-mask with relevant bits set to one.
- ``prefix``: generate bit-mask from a prefix length.

These yield identical results::

   ipv4 src is 10.1.1.1

::

   ipv4 src spec 10.1.1.1 src mask 255.255.255.255

::

   ipv4 src spec 10.1.1.1 src prefix 32

::

   ipv4 src is 10.1.1.1 src last 10.1.1.1 # range with a single value

::

   ipv4 src is 10.1.1.1 src last 0 # 0 disables range

Inclusive ranges can be defined with ``last``::

   ipv4 src is 10.1.1.1 src last 10.2.3.4 # 10.1.1.1 to 10.2.3.4

Note that ``mask`` affects both ``spec`` and ``last``::

   ipv4 src is 10.1.1.1 src last 10.2.3.4 src mask 255.255.0.0
      # matches 10.1.0.0 to 10.2.255.255

Properties can be modified multiple times::

   ipv4 src is 10.1.1.1 src is 10.1.2.3 src is 10.2.3.4 # matches 10.2.3.4

::

   ipv4 src is 10.1.1.1 src prefix 24 src prefix 16 # matches 10.1.0.0/16

Actions list
^^^^^^^^^^^^

A list of actions starts after the ``actions`` token in the same fashion as
`Matching pattern`_; actions are separated by ``/`` tokens and the list is
terminated by a mandatory ``end`` action.

Actions are named after their type (*RTE_FLOW_ACTION_TYPE_* from ``enum
rte_flow_action_type``).

Dropping all incoming UDPv4 packets can be expressed as follows::

   testpmd> flow create 0 ingress pattern eth / ipv4 / udp / end
      actions drop / end

Several actions have configurable properties which must be specified when
there is no valid default value. For example, ``queue`` requires a target
queue index.

This rule redirects incoming UDPv4 traffic to queue index 6::

   testpmd> flow create 0 ingress pattern eth / ipv4 / udp / end
      actions queue index 6 / end

While this one could be rejected by PMDs (unspecified queue index)::

   testpmd> flow create 0 ingress pattern eth / ipv4 / udp / end
      actions queue / end

As defined by *rte_flow*, the list is not ordered, all actions of a given
rule are performed simultaneously. These are equivalent::

   queue index 6 / void / mark id 42 / end

::

   void / mark id 42 / queue index 6 / end

All actions in a list should have different types, otherwise only the last
action of a given type is taken into account::

   queue index 4 / queue index 5 / queue index 6 / end # will use queue 6

::

   drop / drop / drop / end # drop is performed only once

::

   mark id 42 / queue index 3 / mark id 24 / end # mark will be 24

Considering they are performed simultaneously, opposite and overlapping
actions can sometimes be combined when the end result is unambiguous::

   drop / queue index 6 / end # drop has no effect

::

   drop / dup index 6 / end # same as above

::

   queue index 6 / rss queues 6 7 8 / end # queue has no effect

::

   drop / passthru / end # drop has no effect

Note that PMDs may still refuse such combinations.

Actions
^^^^^^^

This section lists supported actions and their attributes, if any.

- ``end``: end list of actions.

- ``void``: no-op action.

- ``passthru``: let subsequent rule process matched packets.

- ``mark``: attach 32 bit value to packets.

  - ``id {unsigned}``: 32 bit value to return with packets.

- ``flag``: flag packets.

- ``queue``: assign packets to a given queue index.

  - ``index {unsigned}``: queue index to use.

- ``drop``: drop packets (note: passthru has priority).

- ``count``: enable counters for this rule.

- ``dup``: duplicate packets to a given queue index.

  - ``index {unsigned}``: queue index to duplicate packets to.

- ``rss``: spread packets among several queues.

  - ``queues [{unsigned} [...]] end``: queue indices to use.

- ``pf``: redirect packets to physical device function.

- ``vf``: redirect packets to virtual device function.

  - ``original {boolean}``: use original VF ID if possible.
  - ``id {unsigned}``: VF ID to redirect packets to.

Destroying flow rules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``flow destroy`` destroys one or more rules from their rule ID (as returned
by ``flow create``), this command calls ``rte_flow_destroy()`` as many
times as necessary::

   flow destroy {port_id} rule {rule_id} [...]

If successful, it will show::

   Flow rule #[...] destroyed

It does not report anything for rule IDs that do not exist. The usual error
message is shown when a rule cannot be destroyed::

   Caught error type [...] ([...]): [...]

``flow flush`` destroys all rules on a device and does not take extra
arguments. It is bound to ``rte_flow_flush()``::

   flow flush {port_id}

Any errors are reported as above.

Creating several rules and destroying them::

   testpmd> flow create 0 ingress pattern eth / ipv6 / end
      actions queue index 2 / end
   Flow rule #0 created
   testpmd> flow create 0 ingress pattern eth / ipv4 / end
      actions queue index 3 / end
   Flow rule #1 created
   testpmd> flow destroy 0 rule 0 rule 1
   Flow rule #1 destroyed
   Flow rule #0 destroyed
   testpmd>

The same result can be achieved using ``flow flush``::

   testpmd> flow create 0 ingress pattern eth / ipv6 / end
      actions queue index 2 / end
   Flow rule #0 created
   testpmd> flow create 0 ingress pattern eth / ipv4 / end
      actions queue index 3 / end
   Flow rule #1 created
   testpmd> flow flush 0
   testpmd>

Non-existent rule IDs are ignored::

   testpmd> flow create 0 ingress pattern eth / ipv6 / end
      actions queue index 2 / end
   Flow rule #0 created
   testpmd> flow create 0 ingress pattern eth / ipv4 / end
      actions queue index 3 / end
   Flow rule #1 created
   testpmd> flow destroy 0 rule 42 rule 10 rule 2
   testpmd>
   testpmd> flow destroy 0 rule 0
   Flow rule #0 destroyed
   testpmd>

Querying flow rules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``flow query`` queries a specific action of a flow rule having that
ability. Such actions collect information that can be reported using this
command. It is bound to ``rte_flow_query()``::

   flow query {port_id} {rule_id} {action}

If successful, it will display either the retrieved data for known actions
or the following message::

   Cannot display result for action type [...] ([...])

Otherwise, it will complain either that the rule does not exist or that some
error occurred::

   Flow rule #[...] not found

::

   Caught error type [...] ([...]): [...]

Currently only the ``count`` action is supported. This action reports the
number of packets that hit the flow rule and the total number of bytes. Its
output has the following format::

   count:
    hits_set: [...] # whether "hits" contains a valid value
    bytes_set: [...] # whether "bytes" contains a valid value
    hits: [...] # number of packets
    bytes: [...] # number of bytes

Querying counters for TCPv6 packets redirected to queue 6::

   testpmd> flow create 0 ingress pattern eth / ipv6 / tcp / end
      actions queue index 6 / count / end
   Flow rule #4 created
   testpmd> flow query 0 4 count
   count:
    hits_set: 1
    bytes_set: 0
    hits: 386446
    bytes: 0
   testpmd>

Listing flow rules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``flow list`` lists existing flow rules sorted by priority and optionally
filtered by group identifiers::

   flow list {port_id} [group {group_id}] [...]

This command only fails with the following message if the device does not
exist::

   Invalid port [...]

Output consists of a header line followed by a short description of each
flow rule, one per line. There is no output at all when no flow rules are
configured on the device::

   ID      Group   Prio    Attr    Rule
   [...]   [...]   [...]   [...]   [...]

``Attr`` column flags:

- ``i`` for ``ingress``.
- ``e`` for ``egress``.

Creating several flow rules and listing them::

   testpmd> flow create 0 ingress pattern eth / ipv4 / end
      actions queue index 6 / end
   Flow rule #0 created
   testpmd> flow create 0 ingress pattern eth / ipv6 / end
      actions queue index 2 / end
   Flow rule #1 created
   testpmd> flow create 0 priority 5 ingress pattern eth / ipv4 / udp / end
      actions rss queues 6 7 8 end / end
   Flow rule #2 created
   testpmd> flow list 0
   ID      Group   Prio    Attr    Rule
   0       0       0       i-      ETH IPV4 => QUEUE
   1       0       0       i-      ETH IPV6 => QUEUE
   2       0       5       i-      ETH IPV4 UDP => RSS
   testpmd>

Rules are sorted by priority (i.e. group ID first, then priority level)::

   testpmd> flow list 1
   ID      Group   Prio    Attr    Rule
   0       0       0       i-      ETH => COUNT
   6       0       500     i-      ETH IPV6 TCP => DROP COUNT
   5       0       1000    i-      ETH IPV6 ICMP => QUEUE
   1       24      0       i-      ETH IPV4 UDP => QUEUE
   4       24      10      i-      ETH IPV4 TCP => DROP
   3       24      20      i-      ETH IPV4 => DROP
   2       24      42      i-      ETH IPV4 UDP => QUEUE
   7       63      0       i-      ETH IPV6 UDP VXLAN => MARK QUEUE
   testpmd>

Output can be limited to specific groups::

   testpmd> flow list 1 group 0 group 63
   ID      Group   Prio    Attr    Rule
   0       0       0       i-      ETH => COUNT
   6       0       500     i-      ETH IPV6 TCP => DROP COUNT
   5       0       1000    i-      ETH IPV6 ICMP => QUEUE
   7       63      0       i-      ETH IPV6 UDP VXLAN => MARK QUEUE
   testpmd>

Toggling isolated mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``flow isolate`` can be used to tell the underlying PMD that ingress traffic
must only be injected from the defined flow rules; that no default traffic
is expected outside those rules and the driver is free to assign more
resources to handle them. It is bound to ``rte_flow_isolate()``::

 flow isolate {port_id} {boolean}

If successful, enabling or disabling isolated mode shows either::

 Ingress traffic on port [...]
    is now restricted to the defined flow rules

Or::

 Ingress traffic on port [...]
    is not restricted anymore to the defined flow rules

Otherwise, in case of error::

   Caught error type [...] ([...]): [...]

Mainly due to its side effects, PMDs supporting this mode may not have the
ability to toggle it more than once without reinitializing affected ports
first (e.g. by exiting testpmd).

Enabling isolated mode::

 testpmd> flow isolate 0 true
 Ingress traffic on port 0 is now restricted to the defined flow rules
 testpmd>

Disabling isolated mode::

 testpmd> flow isolate 0 false
 Ingress traffic on port 0 is not restricted anymore to the defined flow rules
 testpmd>

Sample QinQ flow rules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before creating QinQ rule(s) the following commands should be issued to enable QinQ::

   testpmd> port stop 0
   testpmd> vlan set qinq on 0

The above command sets the inner and outer TPID's to 0x8100.

To change the TPID's the following commands should be used::

   testpmd> vlan set outer tpid 0xa100 0
   testpmd> vlan set inner tpid 0x9100 0
   testpmd> port start 0

Validate and create a QinQ rule on port 0 to steer traffic to a VF queue in a VM.

::

   testpmd> flow validate 0 ingress pattern eth / vlan tci is 123 /
       vlan tci is 456 / end actions vf id 1 / queue index 0 / end
   Flow rule #0 validated

   testpmd> flow create 0 ingress pattern eth / vlan tci is 4 /
       vlan tci is 456 / end actions vf id 123 / queue index 0 / end
   Flow rule #0 created

   testpmd> flow list 0
   ID      Group   Prio    Attr    Rule
   0       0       0       i-      ETH VLAN VLAN=>VF QUEUE

Validate and create a QinQ rule on port 0 to steer traffic to a queue on the host.

::

   testpmd> flow validate 0 ingress pattern eth / vlan tci is 321 /
        vlan tci is 654 / end actions pf / queue index 0 / end
   Flow rule #1 validated

   testpmd> flow create 0 ingress pattern eth / vlan tci is 321 /
        vlan tci is 654 / end actions pf / queue index 1 / end
   Flow rule #1 created

   testpmd> flow list 0
   ID      Group   Prio    Attr    Rule
   0       0       0       i-      ETH VLAN VLAN=>VF QUEUE
   1       0       0       i-      ETH VLAN VLAN=>PF QUEUE
