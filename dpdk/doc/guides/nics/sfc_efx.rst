Solarflare libefx-based Poll Mode Driver
========================================

The SFC EFX PMD (**librte_net_sfc_efx**) provides poll mode driver support
for **Solarflare SFN7xxx and SFN8xxx** family of 10/40 Gbps adapters,
**Solarflare XtremeScale X2xxx** family of 10/25/40/50/100 Gbps adapters and
**Alveo SN1000 SmartNICs** family of 10/25/40/50/100 Gbps adapters.
SFC EFX PMD has support for the latest Linux and FreeBSD operating systems.

More information can be found at `Solarflare Communications website
<http://solarflare.com>`_.

Non-supported Features
----------------------

The features not yet supported include:

- Priority-based flow control

- Configurable RX CRC stripping (always stripped)

- Header split on receive

- VLAN filtering

- VLAN stripping

- LRO


Limitations
-----------

Due to requirements on receive buffer alignment and usage of the receive
buffer for the auxiliary packet information provided by the NIC up to
extra 269 (14 bytes prefix plus up to 255 bytes for end padding) bytes may be
required in the receive buffer.
It should be taken into account when mbuf pool for receive is created.


Equal stride super-buffer mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When the receive queue uses equal stride super-buffer DMA mode, one HW Rx
descriptor carries many Rx buffers which contiguously follow each other
with some stride (equal to total size of rte_mbuf as mempool object).
Each Rx buffer is an independent rte_mbuf.
However dedicated mempool manager must be used when mempool for the Rx
queue is created. The manager must support dequeue of the contiguous
block of objects and provide mempool info API to get the block size.

Another limitation of a equal stride super-buffer mode, imposed by the
firmware, is that it allows for a single RSS context.


Tunnels support
---------------

NVGRE, VXLAN and GENEVE tunnels are supported on SFN8xxx and X2xxx family
adapters with full-feature firmware variant running.
**sfboot** should be used to configure NIC to run full-feature firmware variant.
See Solarflare Server Adapter User's Guide for details.

SFN8xxx and X2xxx family adapters provide either inner or outer packet classes.
If adapter firmware advertises support for tunnels then the PMD
configures the hardware to report inner classes, and outer classes are
not reported in received packets.
However, for VXLAN and GENEVE tunnels the PMD does report UDP as the
outer layer 4 packet type.

SFN8xxx and X2xxx family adapters report GENEVE packets as VXLAN.
If UDP ports are configured for only one tunnel type then it is safe to
treat VXLAN packet type indication as the corresponding UDP tunnel type.

Validating flow rules depends on the firmware variant.

The :ref:`flow_isolated_mode` is supported.

The implementation is natively thread-safe.

Ethernet destination individual/group match
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ethernet item supports I/G matching, if only the corresponding bit is set
in the mask of destination address. If destination address in the spec is
multicast, it matches all multicast (and broadcast) packets, otherwise it
matches unicast packets that are not filtered by other flow rules.

Exceptions to flow rules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is a list of exceptional flow rule patterns which will not be
accepted by the PMD. A pattern will be rejected if at least one of the
conditions is met:

- Filtering by IPv4 or IPv6 EtherType without pattern items of internet
  layer and above.

- The last item is IPV4 or IPV6, and it's empty.

- Filtering by TCP or UDP IP transport protocol without pattern items of
  transport layer and above.

- The last item is TCP or UDP, and it's empty.

Pre-Installation Configuration
------------------------------


Build Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following build-time options may be enabled on build time using
``-Dc_args=`` meson argument (e.g.  ``-Dc_args=-DRTE_LIBRTE_SFC_EFX_DEBUG``).

Please note that enabling debugging options may affect system performance.

- ``RTE_LIBRTE_SFC_EFX_DEBUG`` (undefined by default)

  Enable compilation of the extra run-time consistency checks.


Per-Device Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following per-device parameters can be passed via EAL PCI device
allow option like "-a 02:00.0,arg1=value1,...".

Case-insensitive 1/y/yes/on or 0/n/no/off may be used to specify
boolean parameters value.

- ``rx_datapath`` [auto|efx|ef10|ef10_essb] (default **auto**)

  Choose receive datapath implementation.
  **auto** allows the driver itself to make a choice based on firmware
  features available and required by the datapath implementation.
  **efx** chooses libefx-based datapath which supports Rx scatter.
  Supported for SFN7xxx, SFN8xxx and X2xxx family adapters only.
  **ef10** chooses EF10 (SFN7xxx, SFN8xxx, X2xxx) native datapath which is
  more efficient than libefx-based and provides richer packet type
  classification.
  **ef10_essb** chooses SFNX2xxx equal stride super-buffer datapath
  which may be used on DPDK firmware variant only
  (see notes about its limitations above).
  **ef100** chooses EF100 native datapath which is the only supported
  Rx datapath for EF100 architecture based NICs.

- ``tx_datapath`` [auto|efx|ef10|ef10_simple|ef100] (default **auto**)

  Choose transmit datapath implementation.
  **auto** allows the driver itself to make a choice based on firmware
  features available and required by the datapath implementation.
  **efx** chooses libefx-based datapath which supports VLAN insertion
  (full-feature firmware variant only), TSO and multi-segment mbufs.
  Mbuf segments may come from different mempools, and mbuf reference
  counters are treated responsibly.
  Supported for SFN7xxx, SFN8xxx and X2xxx family adapters only.
  **ef10** chooses EF10 (SFN7xxx, SFN8xxx, X2xxx) native datapath which is
  more efficient than libefx-based but has no VLAN insertion support yet.
  Mbuf segments may come from different mempools, and mbuf reference
  counters are treated responsibly.
  **ef10_simple** chooses EF10 (SFN7xxx, SFN8xxx, X2xxx) native datapath which
  is even more faster then **ef10** but does not support multi-segment
  mbufs, disallows multiple mempools and neglects mbuf reference counters.
  **ef100** chooses EF100 native datapath which supports multi-segment
  mbufs, VLAN insertion, inner/outer IPv4 and TCP/UDP checksum and TCP
  segmentation offloads including VXLAN and GENEVE IPv4/IPv6 tunnels.

- ``perf_profile`` [auto|throughput|low-latency] (default **throughput**)

  Choose hardware tuning to be optimized for either throughput or
  low-latency.
  **auto** allows NIC firmware to make a choice based on
  installed licenses and firmware variant configured using **sfboot**.

- ``stats_update_period_ms`` [long] (default **1000**)

  Adjust period in milliseconds to update port hardware statistics.
  The accepted range is 0 to 65535. The value of **0** may be used
  to disable periodic statistics update. One should note that it's
  only possible to set an arbitrary value on SFN8xxx and X2xxx provided that
  firmware version is 6.2.1.1033 or higher, otherwise any positive
  value will select a fixed update period of **1000** milliseconds

- ``fw_variant`` [dont-care|full-feature|ultra-low-latency|
  capture-packed-stream|dpdk] (default **dont-care**)

  Choose the preferred firmware variant to use.
  The parameter is supported for SFN7xxX, SFN8xxx and X2xxx families only.
  In order for the selected option to have an effect, the **sfboot** utility
  must be configured with the **auto** firmware-variant option.
  The preferred firmware variant applies to all ports on the NIC.
  **dont-care** ensures that the driver can attach to an unprivileged function.
  The datapath firmware type to use is controlled by the **sfboot**
  utility.
  **full-feature** chooses full featured firmware.
  **ultra-low-latency** chooses firmware with fewer features but lower latency.
  **capture-packed-stream** chooses firmware for SolarCapture packed stream
  mode.
  **dpdk** chooses DPDK firmware with equal stride super-buffer Rx mode
  for higher Rx packet rate and packet marks support and firmware subvariant
  without checksumming on transmit for higher Tx packet rate if
  checksumming is not required.

- ``rxd_wait_timeout_ns`` [long] (default **200 us**)

  Adjust timeout in nanoseconds to head-of-line block to wait for
  Rx descriptors.
  The accepted range is 0 to 400 ms.
  Flow control should be enabled to make it work.
  The value of **0** disables it and packets are dropped immediately.
  When a packet is dropped because of no Rx descriptors,
  ``rx_nodesc_drop_cnt`` counter grows.
  The feature is supported only by the DPDK firmware variant when equal
  stride super-buffer Rx mode is used.


Dynamic Logging Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

One may leverage EAL option "--log-level" to change default levels
for the log types supported by the driver. The option is used with
an argument typically consisting of two parts separated by a colon.

Level value is the last part which takes a symbolic name (or integer).
Log type is the former part which may shell match syntax.
Depending on the choice of the expression, the given log level may
be used either for some specific log type or for a subset of types.

SFC EFX PMD provides the following log types available for control:

- ``pmd.net.sfc.driver`` (default level is **notice**)

  Affects driver-wide messages unrelated to any particular devices.

- ``pmd.net.sfc.main`` (default level is **notice**)

  Matches a subset of per-port log types registered during runtime.
  A full name for a particular type may be obtained by appending a
  dot and a PCI device identifier (``XXXX:XX:XX.X``) to the prefix.

- ``pmd.net.sfc.mcdi`` (default level is **notice**)

  Extra logging of the communication with the NIC's management CPU.
  The format of the log is consumed by the Solarflare netlogdecode
  cross-platform tool. May be managed per-port, as explained above.
