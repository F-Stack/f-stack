BNX2X Poll Mode Driver
======================

The BNX2X poll mode driver library (**librte_pmd_bnx2x**) implements support
for **QLogic 578xx** 10/20 Gbps family of adapters as well as their virtual
functions (VF) in SR-IOV context. It is supported on several standard Linux
distros like Red Hat 7.x and SLES12 OS. It is compile-tested under FreeBSD OS.

More information can be found at `QLogic Corporation's Official Website
<http://www.qlogic.com>`_.

Supported Features
------------------

BNX2X PMD has support for:

- Base L2 features
- Unicast/multicast filtering
- Promiscuous mode
- Port hardware statistics
- SR-IOV VF

Non-supported Features
----------------------

The features not yet supported include:

- TSS (Transmit Side Scaling)
- RSS (Receive Side Scaling)
- LRO/TSO offload
- Checksum offload
- SR-IOV PF
- Rx TX scatter gather

Co-existence considerations
---------------------------

- BCM578xx being a CNA can have both NIC and Storage personalities.
  However, coexistence with storage protocol drivers (cnic, bnx2fc and
  bnx2fi) is not supported on the same adapter. So storage personality
  has to be disabled on that adapter when used in DPDK applications.

- For SR-IOV case, bnx2x PMD will be used to bind to SR-IOV VF device and
  Linux native kernel driver (bnx2x) will be attached to SR-IOV PF.


Supported QLogic NICs
---------------------

- 578xx

Prerequisites
-------------

- Requires firmware version **7.2.51.0**. It is included in most of the
  standard Linux distros. If it is not available visit
  `QLogic Driver Download Center <http://driverdownloads.qlogic.com>`_
  to get the required firmware.

Linux Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sample Application Notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section demonstrates how to launch ``testpmd`` with QLogic 578xx
devices managed by ``librte_pmd_bnx2x`` in Linux operating system.

#. Request huge pages:

   .. code-block:: console

      echo 1024 > /sys/kernel/mm/hugepages/hugepages-2048kB/nr_hugepages/nr_hugepages

#. Load ``igb_uio`` or ``vfio-pci`` driver:

   .. code-block:: console

      insmod ./x86_64-native-linuxapp-gcc/kmod/igb_uio.ko

   or

   .. code-block:: console

      modprobe vfio-pci

#. Bind the QLogic adapters to ``igb_uio`` or ``vfio-pci`` loaded in the
   previous step::

      ./tools/dpdk-devbind.py --bind igb_uio 0000:84:00.0 0000:84:00.1

   or

   Setup VFIO permissions for regular users and then bind to ``vfio-pci``:

   .. code-block:: console

      sudo chmod a+x /dev/vfio

      sudo chmod 0666 /dev/vfio/*

      ./tools/dpdk-devbind.py --bind vfio-pci 0000:84:00.0 0000:84:00.1

#. Start ``testpmd`` with basic parameters:

   .. code-block:: console

      ./x86_64-native-linuxapp-gcc/app/testpmd -c 0xf -n 4 -- -i

   Example output:

   .. code-block:: console

SR-IOV: Prerequisites and sample Application Notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section provides instructions to configure SR-IOV with Linux OS.

#. Verify SR-IOV and ARI capabilities are enabled on the adapter using ``lspci``:

   .. code-block:: console

      lspci -s <slot> -vvv

   Example output:

   .. code-block:: console

      [...]
      Capabilities: [1b8 v1] Alternative Routing-ID Interpretation (ARI)
      [...]
      Capabilities: [1c0 v1] Single Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV)
      [...]
      Kernel driver in use: igb_uio

#. Load the kernel module:

   .. code-block:: console

      modprobe bnx2x

   Example output:

   .. code-block:: console

      systemd-udevd[4848]: renamed network interface eth0 to ens5f0
      systemd-udevd[4848]: renamed network interface eth1 to ens5f1

#. Bring up the PF ports:

   .. code-block:: console

      ifconfig ens5f0 up
      ifconfig ens5f1 up

#. Create VF device(s):

   Echo the number of VFs to be created into "sriov_numvfs" sysfs entry
   of the parent PF.

   Example output:

   .. code-block:: console

      echo 2 > /sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:03.0/0000:81:00.0/sriov_numvfs


#. Assign VF MAC address:

   Assign MAC address to the VF using iproute2 utility. The syntax is:
   ip link set <PF iface> vf <VF id> mac <macaddr>

   Example output:

   .. code-block:: console

      ip link set ens5f0 vf 0 mac 52:54:00:2f:9d:e8


#. PCI Passthrough:

   The VF devices may be passed through to the guest VM using virt-manager or
   virsh etc. bnx2x PMD should be used to bind the VF devices in the guest VM
   using the instructions outlined in the Application notes below.
