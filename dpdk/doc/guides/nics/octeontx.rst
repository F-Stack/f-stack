Driver compilation and testing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Refer to the document :ref:`compiling and testing a PMD for a NIC <pmd_build_and_test>`
for details.

To compile the OCTEONTX PMD for Linux arm64 gcc target, run the
following ``make`` command:

.. code-block:: console

   cd <DPDK-source-directory>
   make config T=arm64-thunderx-linuxapp-gcc install

#. Running testpmd:

   Follow instructions available in the document
   :ref:`compiling and testing a PMD for a NIC <pmd_build_and_test>`
   to run testpmd.

   Example output:

   .. code-block:: console

      ./arm64-thunderx-linuxapp-gcc/app/testpmd -c 700 \

Initialization
--------------

The octeontx ethdev pmd is exposed as a vdev device which consists of a set
of PKI and PKO PCIe VF devices. On EAL initialization,
PKI/PKO PCIe VF devices will be probed and then the vdev device can be created
from the application code, or from the EAL command line based on
the number of probed/bound PKI/PKO PCIe VF device to DPDK by

* Invoking ``rte_vdev_init("eth_octeontx")`` from the application

* Using ``--vdev="eth_octeontx"`` in the EAL options, which will call
  rte_vdev_init() internally

Device arguments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Each ethdev port is mapped to a physical port(LMAC), Application can specify
the number of interesting ports with ``nr_ports`` argument.

Dependency
~~~~~~~~~~
``eth_octeontx`` pmd is depend on ``event_octeontx`` eventdev device and
``octeontx_fpavf`` external mempool handler.

Example:

.. code-block:: console

    ./your_dpdk_application --mbuf-pool-ops-name="octeontx_fpavf" \
                --vdev='event_octeontx' \
                --vdev="eth_octeontx,nr_port=2"

Limitations
-----------

``octeontx_fpavf`` external mempool handler dependency
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The OCTEONTX SoC family NIC has inbuilt HW assisted external mempool manager.
This driver will only work with ``octeontx_fpavf`` external mempool handler
as it is the most performance effective way for packet allocation and Tx buffer
recycling on OCTEONTX SoC platform.

CRC striping
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The OCTEONTX SoC family NICs strip the CRC for every packets coming into the
host interface. So, CRC will be stripped even when the
``rxmode.hw_strip_crc`` member is set to 0 in ``struct rte_eth_conf``.

Maximum packet length
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The OCTEONTX SoC family NICs support a maximum of a 32K jumbo frame. The value
is fixed and cannot be changed. So, even when the ``rxmode.max_rx_pkt_len``
member of ``struct rte_eth_conf`` is set to a value lower than 32k, frames
up to 32k bytes can still reach the host interface.
