Dynamic Device Personalization (DDP) package loading
----------------------------------------------------

The Intel E810 requires a programmable pipeline package
be downloaded by the driver to support normal operations.
The E810 has limited functionality built in to allow PXE boot and other use cases,
but for DPDK use the driver must download a package file during the driver initialization stage.

The default DDP package file name is ``ice.pkg``.
For a specific NIC, the DDP package supposed to be loaded can have a filename:
``ice-xxxxxx.pkg``, where 'xxxxxx' is the 64-bit PCIe Device Serial Number of the NIC.
For example, if the NIC's device serial number is 00-CC-BB-FF-FF-AA-05-68,
the device-specific DDP package filename is ``ice-00ccbbffffaa0568.pkg`` (in hex and all low case).
A symbolic link to the DDP package file is also ok.
The same package file is used by both the kernel driver and the ICE PMD.
For more information, please review the README file from
`Intel® Ethernet 800 Series Dynamic Device Personalization (DDP) for Telecommunication (Comms) Package
<https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/download/19660/intel-ethernet-800-series-dynamic-device-personalization-ddp-for-telecommunication-comms-package.html>`_.

ICE PMD supports using a customized DDP search path.
The driver will read the search path from
``/sys/module/firmware_class/parameters/path`` as a ``CUSTOMIZED_PATH``.
During initialization, the driver searches in the following paths in order:
``CUSTOMIZED_PATH``, ``/lib/firmware/updates/intel/ice/ddp`` and ``/lib/firmware/intel/ice/ddp``.
The device-specific DDP package has a higher loading priority than default DDP package, ``ice.pkg``.

.. note::

   Windows support: DDP packages are not supported on Windows.

Configuration
-------------

Runtime Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- ``Safe Mode Support`` (default ``0``)

  If driver failed to load OS package, by default driver's initialization failed.
  But if user intend to use the device without OS package, user can take ``devargs``
  parameter ``safe-mode-support``, for example::

    -a 80:00.0,safe-mode-support=1

  Then the driver will be initialized successfully and the device will enter Safe Mode.
  NOTE: In Safe mode, only very limited features are available, features like RSS,
  checksum, fdir, tunneling ... are all disabled.

- ``Default MAC Disable`` (default ``0``)

  Disable the default MAC make the device drop all packets by default,
  only packets hit on filter rules will pass.

  Default MAC can be disabled by setting the devargs parameter ``default-mac-disable``,
  for example::

    -a 80:00.0,default-mac-disable=1

- ``DDP Package File``

  Rather than have the driver search for the DDP package to load,
  or to override what package is used,
  the ``ddp_pkg_file`` option can be used to provide the path to a specific package file.
  For example::

    -a 80:00.0,ddp_pkg_file=/path/to/ice-version.pkg

- ``Traffic Management Scheduling Levels``

  The DPDK Traffic Management (rte_tm) APIs can be used to configure the Tx scheduler on the NIC.
  From 24.11 release, all available hardware layers are available to software.
  Earlier versions of DPDK only supported 3 levels in the scheduling hierarchy.
  To help with backward compatibility the ``tm_sched_levels`` parameter
  can be used to limit the scheduler levels to the provided value.
  The provided value must be between 3 and 8.
  If the value provided is greater than the number of levels provided by the HW,
  SW will use the hardware maximum value.

- ``Protocol extraction for per queue``

  Configure the RX queues to do protocol extraction into mbuf for protocol
  handling acceleration, like checking the TCP SYN packets quickly.

  The argument format is::

      18:00.0,proto_xtr=<queues:protocol>[<queues:protocol>...],field_offs=<offset>, \
      field_name=<name>
      18:00.0,proto_xtr=<protocol>,field_offs=<offset>,field_name=<name>

  Queues are grouped by ``(`` and ``)`` within the group. The ``-`` character
  is used as a range separator and ``,`` is used as a single number separator.
  The grouping ``()`` can be omitted for single element group. If no queues are
  specified, PMD will use this protocol extraction type for all queues.
  ``field_offs`` is the offset of mbuf dynamic field for protocol extraction data.
  ``field_name`` is the name of mbuf dynamic field for protocol extraction data.
  ``field_offs`` and ``field_name`` will be checked whether it is valid. If invalid,
  an error print will be returned: ``Invalid field offset or name, no match dynfield``,
  and the proto_ext function will not be enabled.

  Protocol is : ``vlan, ipv4, ipv6, ipv6_flow, tcp, ip_offset``.

  .. code-block:: console

    dpdk-testpmd -c 0xff -- -i
    port stop 0
    port detach 0
    port attach 18:00.0,proto_xtr='[(1,2-3,8-9):tcp,10-13:vlan]',field_offs=92,field_name=pmd_dyn

  This setting means queues 1, 2-3, 8-9 are TCP extraction, queues 10-13 are
  VLAN extraction, other queues run with no protocol extraction. The offset of mbuf
  dynamic field is 92 for all queues with protocol extraction.

  .. code-block:: console

    dpdk-testpmd -c 0xff -- -i
    port stop 0
    port detach 0
    port attach 18:00.0,proto_xtr=vlan,proto_xtr='[(1,2-3,8-9):tcp,10-23:ipv6]', \
    field_offs=92,field_name=pmd_dyn

  This setting means queues 1, 2-3, 8-9 are TCP extraction, queues 10-23 are
  IPv6 extraction, other queues use the default VLAN extraction. The offset of mbuf
  dynamic field is 92 for all queues with protocol extraction.

  The extraction metadata is copied into the registered dynamic mbuf field, and
  the related dynamic mbuf flags is set.

  .. table:: Protocol extraction : ``vlan``

   +----------------------------+----------------------------+

  IPHDR1 - Outer/Single IPv4 Header offset.

  IPHDR2 - Outer/Single IPv6 Header offset.

- ``Hardware debug mask log support`` (default ``0``)

  User can enable the related hardware debug mask such as ICE_DBG_NVM::

    -a 0000:88:00.0,hw_debug_mask=0x80 --log-level=pmd.net.ice.driver:8

  These ICE_DBG_XXX are defined in ``drivers/net/ice/base/ice_type.h``.

- ``1PPS out support``

  The E810 supports four single-ended GPIO signals (SDP[20:23]). The 1PPS
  signal outputs via SDP[20:23]. User can select GPIO pin index flexibly.
  Pin index 0 means SDP20, 1 means SDP21 and so on. For example::

    -a af:00.0,pps_out='[pin:0]'

- ``Low Rx latency`` (default ``0``)

  vRAN workloads require low latency DPDK interface for the front haul
  interface connection to Radio. By specifying ``1`` for parameter
  ``rx_low_latency``, each completed Rx descriptor can be written immediately
  to host memory and the Rx interrupt latency can be reduced to 2us::

    -a 0000:88:00.0,rx_low_latency=1

  As a trade-off, this configuration may cause the packet processing performance
  degradation due to the PCI bandwidth limitation.

- ``Tx Scheduler Topology Download``

  The default Tx scheduler topology exposed by the NIC,
  generally a 9-level topology of which 8 levels are SW configurable,
  may be updated by a new topology loaded from a DDP package file.
  The ``ddp_load_sched_topo`` option can be used to specify that the scheduler topology,
  if any, in the DDP package file being used should be loaded into the NIC.
  For example::

    -a 0000:88:00.0,ddp_load_sched_topo=1

  or::

    -a 0000:88:00.0,ddp_pkg_file=/path/to/pkg.file,ddp_load_sched_topo=1

- ``Tx diagnostics`` (default ``not enabled``)

  Set the ``devargs`` parameter ``mbuf_check`` to enable Tx diagnostics.
  For example, ``-a 81:00.0,mbuf_check=<case>`` or ``-a 81:00.0,mbuf_check=[<case1>,<case2>...]``.
  Thereafter, ``rte_eth_xstats_get()`` can be used to get the error counts,
  which are collected in ``tx_mbuf_error_packets`` xstats.
  In testpmd these can be shown via: ``testpmd> show port xstats all``.
  Supported values for the ``case`` parameter are:

  * ``mbuf``: Check for corrupted mbuf.
  * ``size``: Check min/max packet length according to HW spec.
  * ``segment``: Check number of mbuf segments does not exceed HW limits.
  * ``offload``: Check for use of an unsupported offload flag.

Driver compilation and testing
------------------------------

Refer to the document :ref:`compiling and testing a PMD for a NIC <pmd_build_and_test>`
for details.

Features
--------

Vector PMD
~~~~~~~~~~

Vector PMD for RX and TX path are selected automatically. The paths
are chosen based on 2 conditions.

- ``CPU``
  On the X86 platform, the driver checks if the CPU supports AVX2.
  If it's supported, AVX2 paths will be chosen. If not, SSE is chosen.
  If the CPU supports AVX512 and EAL argument ``--force-max-simd-bitwidth``
  is set to 512, AVX512 paths will be chosen.

- ``Offload features``
  The supported HW offload features are described in the document ice.ini,
  A value "P" means the offload feature is not supported by vector path.
  If any not supported features are used, ICE vector PMD is disabled and the
  normal paths are chosen.

Malicious driver detection (MDD)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It's not appropriate to send a packet, if this packet's destination MAC address
is just this port's MAC address. If SW tries to send such packets, HW will
report a MDD event and drop the packets.

The APPs based on DPDK should avoid providing such packets.

Device Config Function (DCF)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section demonstrates ICE DCF PMD, which shares the core module with ICE
PMD and iAVF PMD.

A DCF (Device Config Function) PMD bounds to the device's trusted VF with ID 0,
it can act as a sole controlling entity to exercise advance functionality (such
as switch, ACL) for the rest VFs.

The DCF PMD needs to advertise and acquire DCF capability which allows DCF to
send AdminQ commands that it would like to execute over to the PF and receive
responses for the same from PF.

Forward Error Correction (FEC)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Supports get/set FEC mode and get FEC capability.

Time Synchronisation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The system operator can run a PTP (Precision Time Protocol) client application
to synchronise the time on the network card
(and optionally the time on the system) to the PTP master.

ICE PMD supports PTP client applications that use the DPDK IEEE 1588 API
to communicate with the PTP master clock.
Note that PTP client application needs to run on PF
and add the ``--force-max-simd-bitwidth=64`` startup parameter to disable vector mode.

.. code-block:: console

   examples/dpdk-ptpclient -c f -n 3 -a 0000:ec:00.1 --force-max-simd-bitwidth=64 -- -T 1 -p 0x1 -c 1

Generic Flow Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ice PMD provides support for the Generic Flow API (RTE_FLOW), enabling
users to offload various flow classification tasks to the E810 NIC.
The E810 NIC's  packet processing pipeline consists of the following stages:

Switch: Supports exact match and limited wildcard matching with a large flow
capacity.

ACL: Supports wildcard matching with a smaller flow capacity (DCF mode only).

FDIR: Supports exact match with a large flow capacity (PF mode only).

Hash: Supports RSS (PF mode only)

The ice PMD utilizes the ice_flow_engine structure to represent each of these
stages and leverages the rte_flow rule's ``group`` attribute for selecting the
appropriate engine for Switch, ACL, and FDIR operations:

Group 0 maps to Switch
Group 1 maps to ACL
Group 2 maps to FDIR

In the case of RSS, it will only be selected if a ``RTE_FLOW_ACTION_RSS`` action
is targeted to no queue group, and the group attribute is ignored.

For each engine, a list of supported patterns is maintained in a global array
named ``ice_<engine>_supported_pattern``. The Ice PMD will reject any rule with
a pattern that is not included in the supported list.

One notable feature is the ice PMD's ability to leverage the Raw pattern,
enabling protocol-agnostic flow offloading. Here is an example of creating
a rule that matches an IPv4 destination address of 1.2.3.4 and redirects it to
queue 3 using a raw pattern::

  flow create 0 ingress group 2 pattern raw \
  pattern spec \
  00000000000000000000000008004500001400004000401000000000000001020304 \
  pattern mask \
  000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000ffffffff \
  end actions queue index 3 / mark id 3 / end

Currently, raw pattern support is limited to the FDIR and Hash engines.

Traffic Management Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ice PMD provides support for the Traffic Management API (RTE_TM),
enabling users to configure and manage the traffic shaping and scheduling of transmitted packets.
By default, all available transmit scheduler layers are available for configuration,
allowing up to 2000 queues to be configured in a hierarchy of up to 8 levels.
The number of levels in the hierarchy can be adjusted via driver parameters:

* the default 9-level topology (8 levels usable) can be replaced by a new topology downloaded from a DDP file,
  using the driver parameter ``ddp_load_sched_topo=1``.
  Using this mechanism, if the number of levels is reduced,
  the possible fan-out of child-nodes from each level may be increased.
  The default topology is a 9-level tree with a fan-out of 8 at each level.
  Released DDP package files contain a 5-level hierarchy (4-levels usable),
  with increased fan-out at the lower 3 levels
  e.g. 64 at levels 2 and 3, and 256 or more at the leaf-node level.

* the number of levels can be reduced
  by setting the driver parameter ``tm_sched_levels`` to a lower value.
  This scheme will reduce in software the number of editable levels,
  but will not affect the fan-out from each level.

For more details on how to configure a Tx scheduling hierarchy,
please refer to the ``rte_tm`` `API documentation <https://doc.dpdk.org/api/rte__tm_8h.html>`_.

Additional Options
++++++++++++++++++

- ``Disable ACL Engine`` (default ``enabled``)

  By default, all flow engines are enabled. But if user does not need the
  ACL engine related functions, user can set ``devargs`` parameter
  ``acl=off`` to disable the ACL engine and shorten the startup time.

    -a 18:01.0,cap=dcf,acl=off

.. _figure_ice_dcf:

.. figure:: img/ice_dcf.*

   DCF Communication flow.

#. Create the VFs::

      echo 4 > /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000\:18\:00.0/sriov_numvfs

#. Enable the VF0 trust on::

      ip link set dev enp24s0f0 vf 0 trust on

#. Bind the VF0, and run testpmd with 'cap=dcf' with port representor for VF 1 and 2::

      dpdk-testpmd -l 22-25 -n 4 -a 18:01.0,cap=dcf,representor=vf[1-2] -- -i

#. Monitor the VF2 interface network traffic::

      tcpdump -e -nn -i enp24s1f2

#. Create one flow to redirect the traffic to VF2 by DCF (assume the representor port ID is 5)::

      flow create 0 priority 0 ingress pattern eth / ipv4 src is 192.168.0.2 \
      dst is 192.168.0.3 / end actions represented_port ethdev_port_id 5 / end

#. Send the packet, and it should be displayed on tcpdump::

      sendp(Ether(src='3c:fd:fe:aa:bb:78', dst='00:00:00:01:02:03')/IP(src=' \
      192.168.0.2', dst="192.168.0.3")/TCP(flags='S')/Raw(load='XXXXXXXXXX'), \
      iface="enp24s0f0", count=10)

Sample Application Notes
------------------------

Vlan filter
~~~~~~~~~~~

Vlan filter only works when Promiscuous mode is off.

To start ``testpmd``, and add vlan 10 to port 0:

.. code-block:: console

    ./app/dpdk-testpmd -l 0-15 -n 4 -- -i
