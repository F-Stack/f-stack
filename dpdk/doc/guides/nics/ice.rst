ICE Poll Mode Driver
======================

The ice PMD (librte_pmd_ice) provides poll mode driver support for
10/25 Gbps Intel® Ethernet 810 Series Network Adapters based on
the Intel Ethernet Controller E810.


Prerequisites
-------------

- Identifying your adapter using `Intel Support
  <http://www.intel.com/support>`_ and get the latest NVM/FW images.

- Follow the DPDK :ref:`Getting Started Guide for Linux <linux_gsg>` to setup the basic DPDK environment.

- To get better performance on Intel platforms, please follow the "How to get best performance with NICs on Intel platforms"
  section of the :ref:`Getting Started Guide for Linux <linux_gsg>`.

Recommended Matching List
-------------------------

It is highly recommended to upgrade the ice kernel driver and firmware and
DDP packages to avoid the compatibility issues with ice PMD. Here is the
suggested matching list.

   +----------------------+-----------------------+------------------+----------------+-------------------+
   |     DPDK version     | Kernel driver version | Firmware version | DDP OS Package | DDP COMMS Package |
   +======================+=======================+==================+================+===================+
   |        19.11         |        0.12.25        |     1.1.16.39    |      1.3.4     |       1.3.10      |
   +----------------------+-----------------------+------------------+----------------+-------------------+
   | 19.08 (experimental) |        0.10.1         |     1.1.12.7     |      1.2.0     |        N/A        |
   +----------------------+-----------------------+------------------+----------------+-------------------+
   | 19.05 (experimental) |        0.9.4          |     1.1.10.16    |      1.1.0     |        N/A        |
   +----------------------+-----------------------+------------------+----------------+-------------------+

Pre-Installation Configuration
------------------------------

Config File Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following options can be modified in the ``config`` file.
Please note that enabling debugging options may affect system performance.

- ``CONFIG_RTE_LIBRTE_ICE_PMD`` (default ``y``)

  Toggle compilation of the ``librte_pmd_ice`` driver.

- ``CONFIG_RTE_LIBRTE_ICE_DEBUG_*`` (default ``n``)

  Toggle display of generic debugging messages.

- ``CONFIG_RTE_LIBRTE_ICE_16BYTE_RX_DESC`` (default ``n``)

  Toggle to use a 16-byte RX descriptor, by default the RX descriptor is 32 byte.

Runtime Config Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- ``Safe Mode Support`` (default ``0``)

  If driver failed to load OS package, by default driver's initialization failed.
  But if user intend to use the device without OS package, user can take ``devargs``
  parameter ``safe-mode-support``, for example::

    -w 80:00.0,safe-mode-support=1

  Then the driver will be initialized successfully and the device will enter Safe Mode.
  NOTE: In Safe mode, only very limited features are available, features like RSS,
  checksum, fdir, tunneling ... are all disabled.

- ``Generic Flow Pipeline Mode Support`` (default ``0``)

  In pipeline mode, a flow can be set at one specific stage by setting parameter
  ``priority``. Currently, we support two stages: priority = 0 or !0. Flows with
  priority 0 located at the first pipeline stage which typically be used as a firewall
  to drop the packet on a blacklist(we called it permission stage). At this stage,
  flow rules are created for the device's exact match engine: switch. Flows with priority
  !0 located at the second stage, typically packets are classified here and be steered to
  specific queue or queue group (we called it distribution stage), At this stage, flow
  rules are created for device's flow director engine.
  For none-pipeline mode, ``priority`` is ignored, a flow rule can be created as a flow director
  rule or a switch rule depends on its pattern/action and the resource allocation situation,
  all flows are virtually at the same pipeline stage.
  By default, generic flow API is enabled in none-pipeline mode, user can choose to
  use pipeline mode by setting ``devargs`` parameter ``pipeline-mode-support``,
  for example::

    -w 80:00.0,pipeline-mode-support=1

- ``Flow Mark Support`` (default ``0``)

  This is a hint to the driver to select the data path that supports flow mark extraction
  by default.
  NOTE: This is an experimental devarg, it will be removed when any of below conditions
  is ready.
  1) all data paths support flow mark (currently vPMD does not)
  2) a new offload like RTE_DEV_RX_OFFLOAD_FLOW_MARK be introduced as a standard way to hint.
  Example::

    -w 80:00.0,flow-mark-support=1

- ``Protocol extraction for per queue``

  Configure the RX queues to do protocol extraction into mbuf for protocol
  handling acceleration, like checking the TCP SYN packets quickly.

  The argument format is::

      -w 18:00.0,proto_xtr=<queues:protocol>[<queues:protocol>...]
      -w 18:00.0,proto_xtr=<protocol>

  Queues are grouped by ``(`` and ``)`` within the group. The ``-`` character
  is used as a range separator and ``,`` is used as a single number separator.
  The grouping ``()`` can be omitted for single element group. If no queues are
  specified, PMD will use this protocol extraction type for all queues.

  Protocol is : ``vlan, ipv4, ipv6, ipv6_flow, tcp``.

  .. code-block:: console

    testpmd -w 18:00.0,proto_xtr='[(1,2-3,8-9):tcp,10-13:vlan]'

  This setting means queues 1, 2-3, 8-9 are TCP extraction, queues 10-13 are
  VLAN extraction, other queues run with no protocol extraction.

  .. code-block:: console

    testpmd -w 18:00.0,proto_xtr=vlan,proto_xtr='[(1,2-3,8-9):tcp,10-23:ipv6]'

  This setting means queues 1, 2-3, 8-9 are TCP extraction, queues 10-23 are
  IPv6 extraction, other queues use the default VLAN extraction.

  The extraction metadata is copied into the registered dynamic mbuf field, and
  the related dynamic mbuf flags is set.

  .. table:: Protocol extraction : ``vlan``

   +----------------------------+----------------------------+
   |           VLAN2            |           VLAN1            |

  Use ``rte_net_ice_dynf_proto_xtr_metadata_get`` to access the protocol
  extraction metadata, and use ``RTE_PKT_RX_DYNF_PROTO_XTR_*`` to get the
  metadata type of ``struct rte_mbuf::ol_flags``.

  The ``rte_net_ice_dump_proto_xtr_metadata`` routine shows how to
  access the protocol extraction result in ``struct rte_mbuf``.

Driver compilation and testing
------------------------------

Refer to the document :ref:`compiling and testing a PMD for a NIC <pmd_build_and_test>`
for details.

Features
--------

Vector PMD
~~~~~~~~~~

Vector PMD for RX and TX path are selected automatically. The paths
are chosen based on 2 conditions.

- ``CPU``
  On the X86 platform, the driver checks if the CPU supports AVX2.
  If it's supported, AVX2 paths will be chosen. If not, SSE is chosen.

- ``Offload features``
  The supported HW offload features are described in the document ice_vec.ini.
  If any not supported features are used, ICE vector PMD is disabled and the
  normal paths are chosen.

Malicious driver detection (MDD)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It's not appropriate to send a packet, if this packet's destination MAC address
is just this port's MAC address. If SW tries to send such packets, HW will
report a MDD event and drop the packets.

The APPs based on DPDK should avoid providing such packets.

Sample Application Notes
------------------------

Vlan filter
~~~~~~~~~~~

Vlan filter only works when Promiscuous mode is off.

To start ``testpmd``, and add vlan 10 to port 0:

.. code-block:: console

    ./app/testpmd -l 0-15 -n 4 -- -i
    ...

    testpmd> rx_vlan add 10 0

Limitations or Known issues
---------------------------

The Intel E810 requires a programmable pipeline package be downloaded
by the driver to support normal operations. The E810 has a limited
functionality built in to allow PXE boot and other use cases, but the
driver must download a package file during the driver initialization
stage.

The default DDP package file name is ice.pkg. For a specific NIC, the
DDP package supposed to be loaded can have a filename: ice-xxxxxx.pkg,
where 'xxxxxx' is the 64-bit PCIe Device Serial Number of the NIC. For
example, if the NIC's device serial number is 00-CC-BB-FF-FF-AA-05-68,
the device-specific DDP package filename is ice-00ccbbffffaa0568.pkg
(in hex and all low case). During initialization, the driver searches
in the following paths in order: /lib/firmware/updates/intel/ice/ddp
and /lib/firmware/intel/ice/ddp. The corresponding device-specific DDP
package will be downloaded first if the file exists. If not, then the
driver tries to load the default package. The type of loaded package
is stored in ``ice_adapter->active_pkg_type``.

A symbolic link to the DDP package file is also ok. The same package
file is used by both the kernel driver and the DPDK PMD.

19.02 limitation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ice code released in 19.02 is for evaluation only.
