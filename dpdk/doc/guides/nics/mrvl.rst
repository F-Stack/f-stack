MRVL Poll Mode Driver
======================

The MRVL PMD (librte_pmd_mrvl) provides poll mode driver support
for the Marvell PPv2 (Packet Processor v2) 1/10 Gbps adapter.

Detailed information about SoCs that use PPv2 can be obtained here:

* https://www.marvell.com/embedded-processors/armada-70xx/
* https://www.marvell.com/embedded-processors/armada-80xx/

.. Note::

   Due to external dependencies, this driver is disabled by default. It must
   be enabled manually by setting relevant configuration option manually.
   Please refer to `Config File Options`_ section for further details.


Features
--------

Features of the MRVL PMD are:

- Speed capabilities
- Link status
- Queue start/stop
- MTU update
- Jumbo frame
- Promiscuous mode
- Allmulticast mode
- Unicast MAC filter
- Multicast MAC filter
- RSS hash
- VLAN filter
- CRC offload
- L3 checksum offload
- L4 checksum offload
- Packet type parsing
- Basic stats
- QoS


Limitations
-----------

- Number of lcores is limited to 9 by MUSDK internal design. If more lcores
  need to be allocated, locking will have to be considered. Number of available
  lcores can be changed via ``MRVL_MUSDK_HIFS_RESERVED`` define in
  ``mrvl_ethdev.c`` source file.

- Flushing vlans added for filtering is not possible due to MUSDK missing
  functionality. Current workaround is to reset board so that PPv2 has a
  chance to start in a sane state.


Prerequisites
-------------

- Custom Linux Kernel sources available
  `here <https://github.com/MarvellEmbeddedProcessors/linux-marvell/tree/linux-4.4.52-armada-17.08>`__.

- Out of tree `mvpp2x_sysfs` kernel module sources available
  `here <https://github.com/MarvellEmbeddedProcessors/mvpp2x-marvell/tree/mvpp2x-armada-17.08>`__.

- MUSDK (Marvell User-Space SDK) sources available
  `here <https://github.com/MarvellEmbeddedProcessors/musdk-marvell/tree/musdk-armada-17.08>`__.

    MUSDK is a light-weight library that provides direct access to Marvell's
    PPv2 (Packet Processor v2). Alternatively prebuilt MUSDK library can be
    requested from `Marvell Extranet <https://extranet.marvell.com>`_. Once
    approval has been granted, library can be found by typing ``musdk`` in
    the search box.

    MUSDK must be configured with the following features:

    .. code-block:: console

       --enable-bpool-dma=64

- DPDK environment

    Follow the DPDK :ref:`Getting Started Guide for Linux <linux_gsg>` to setup
    DPDK environment.


Config File Options
-------------------

The following options can be modified in the ``config`` file.

- ``CONFIG_RTE_LIBRTE_MRVL_PMD`` (default ``n``)

    Toggle compilation of the librte_pmd_mrvl driver.

- ``CONFIG_RTE_MRVL_MUSDK_DMA_MEMSIZE`` (default ``41943040``)

    Size in bytes of the contiguous memory region that MUSDK will allocate
    for run-time DMA-able data buffers.


QoS Configuration
-----------------

QoS configuration is done through external configuration file. Path to the
file must be given as `cfg` in driver's vdev parameter list.

Configuration syntax
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: console

   [port <portnum> default]
   default_tc = <default_tc>
   qos_mode = <qos_priority>

   [port <portnum> tc <traffic_class>]
   rxq = <rx_queue_list>
   pcp = <pcp_list>
   dscp = <dscp_list>

   [port <portnum> tc <traffic_class>]
   rxq = <rx_queue_list>
   pcp = <pcp_list>
   dscp = <dscp_list>

Where:

- ``<portnum>``: DPDK Port number (0..n).

- ``<default_tc>``: Default traffic class (e.g. 0)

- ``<qos_priority>``: QoS priority for mapping (`ip`, `vlan`, `ip/vlan` or `vlan/ip`).

- ``<traffic_class>``: Traffic Class to be configured.

- ``<rx_queue_list>``: List of DPDK RX queues (e.g. 0 1 3-4)

- ``<pcp_list>``: List of PCP values to handle in particular TC (e.g. 0 1 3-4 7).

- ``<dscp_list>``: List of DSCP values to handle in particular TC (e.g. 0-12 32-48 63).

Setting PCP/DSCP values for the default TC is not required. All PCP/DSCP
values not assigned explicitly to particular TC will be handled by the
default TC.

Configuration file example
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: console

   [port 0 default]
   default_tc = 0
   qos_mode = ip

   [port 0 tc 0]
   rxq = 0 1

   [port 0 tc 1]
   rxq = 2
   pcp = 5 6 7
   dscp = 26-38

   [port 1 default]
   default_tc = 0
   qos_mode = vlan/ip

   [port 1 tc 0]
   rxq = 0

   [port 1 tc 1]
   rxq = 1 2
   pcp = 5 6 7
   dscp = 26-38

Usage example
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: console

   ./testpmd --vdev=eth_mrvl,iface=eth0,iface=eth2,cfg=/home/user/mrvl.conf \
     -c 7 -- -i -a --disable-hw-vlan-strip --rxq=2


Building DPDK
-------------

Driver needs precompiled MUSDK library during compilation. Please consult
``doc/musdk_get_started.txt`` for the detailed build instructions.

Before the DPDK build process the environmental variable ``LIBMUSDK_PATH`` with
the path to the MUSDK installation directory needs to be exported.


Usage Example
-------------

MRVL PMD requires extra out of tree kernel modules to function properly.
`musdk_uio` and `mv_pp_uio` sources are part of the MUSDK. Please consult
``doc/musdk_get_started.txt`` for the detailed build instructions.
For `mvpp2x_sysfs` please consult ``Documentation/pp22_sysfs.txt`` for the
detailed build instructions.

.. code-block:: console

   insmod musdk_uio.ko
   insmod mv_pp_uio.ko
   insmod mvpp2x_sysfs.ko

Additionally interfaces used by DPDK application need to be put up:

.. code-block:: console

   ip link set eth0 up
   ip link set eth1 up

In order to run testpmd example application following command can be used:

.. code-block:: console

   ./testpmd --vdev=eth_mrvl,iface=eth0,iface=eth2 -c 7 -- \
     --burst=128 --txd=2048 --rxd=1024 --rxq=2 --txq=2  --nb-cores=2 \
     -i -a --disable-hw-vlan-strip --rss-udp
