BNXT Poll Mode Driver
=====================

The BNXT PMD (**librte_pmd_bnxt**) implements support for adapters based on
Ethernet controllers and SoCs belonging to the **Broadcom BCM5730X NetXtreme-C®
Family of Ethernet Network Controllers**, the **Broadcom BCM574XX/BCM575XX
NetXtreme-E® Family of Ethernet Network Controllers**, the **Broadcom BCM588XX
Stingray Family of SmartNIC Adapters**, and the **Broadcom StrataGX® BCM5871X
Series of Communications Processors**.  A complete list with links to reference
material is included below.


BNXT PMD Features
-----------------

The BNXT PMD includes support for the following features:

   * Multiple transmit and receive queues
   * Queue start/stop
   * RSS hash
   * RSS key configuration
   * RSS reta configuration
   * VMDq
   * Packet type parsing
   * Configurable RX CRC stripping
   * L3/L4 checksum offload
   * LRO offload
   * TSO offload
   * VLAN offload
   * SR-IOV VF
   * Basic and extended port statistics
   * Link state reporting
   * Flow control
   * Ethertype filtering
   * N-tuple filtering
   * Promiscuous mode
   * Unicast and multicast MAC filtering
   * Scatter/gather transmit and receive
   * Jumbo frames
   * Vector PMD

BNXT Vector PMD
---------------

The BNXT PMD includes support for SSE vector mode on x86 platforms. Vector
provides significantly improved performance over the base implementation,
however it does not support all of the features that are supported by the
base (non-vector) implementation. Vector mode will be selected and enabled
automatically when the port is started if allowed by the current configuration.

RX Requirements for Vector Mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Vector mode receive will be enabled if the following constraints are met:
   * Packets must fit within a single mbuf (no scatter RX).
   * LRO offload must be disabled.

TX Requirements for Vector Mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Vector mode transmit will be enabled if the following constraints are met:
   * Packets must be contained within a single mbuf (no gather TX).
   * All transmit offloads other than VLAN insertion must be disabled.
