Quick Start Setup Script
========================

The dpdk-setup.sh script, found in the usertools subdirectory, allows the user to perform the following tasks:

*   Build the DPDK libraries

*   Insert and remove the DPDK IGB_UIO kernel module

*   Insert and remove VFIO kernel modules

*   Insert and remove the DPDK KNI kernel module

*   Create and delete hugepages for NUMA and non-NUMA cases

*   View network port status and reserve ports for DPDK application use

*   Set up permissions for using VFIO as a non-privileged user

*   Run the test and testpmd applications

*   Look at hugepages in the meminfo

*   List hugepages in ``/mnt/huge``

*   Remove built DPDK libraries

Once these steps have been completed for one of the EAL targets,
the user may compile their own application that links in the EAL libraries to create the DPDK image.

Script Organization
-------------------

The dpdk-setup.sh script is logically organized into a series of steps that a user performs in sequence.
Each step provides a number of options that guide the user to completing the desired task.
The following is a brief synopsis of each step.

**Step 1: Build DPDK Libraries**

Initially, the user must select a DPDK target to choose the correct target type and compiler options to use when building the libraries.

The user must have all libraries, modules, updates and compilers installed in the system prior to this,
as described in the earlier chapters in this Getting Started Guide.

**Step 2: Setup Environment**

The user configures the Linux* environment to support the running of DPDK applications.
Hugepages can be set up for NUMA or non-NUMA systems. Any existing hugepages will be removed.
The DPDK kernel module that is needed can also be inserted in this step,
and network ports may be bound to this module for DPDK application use.

**Step 3: Run an Application**

The user may run the test application once the other steps have been performed.
The test application allows the user to run a series of functional tests for the DPDK.
The testpmd application, which supports the receiving and sending of packets, can also be run.

**Step 4: Examining the System**

This step provides some tools for examining the status of hugepage mappings.

**Step 5: System Cleanup**

The final step has options for restoring the system to its original state.

Use Cases
---------

The following are some example of how to use the dpdk-setup.sh script.
The script should be run using the source command.
Some options in the script prompt the user for further data before proceeding.

.. warning::

    The dpdk-setup.sh script should be run with root privileges.

The following selection demonstrates the creation of hugepages in a NUMA system.
1024 2 MByte pages are assigned to each node.
The result is that the application should use -m 4096 for starting the application to access both memory areas
(this is done automatically if the -m option is not provided).

    If prompts are displayed to remove temporary files, type 'y'.

Applications
------------

Once the user has run the dpdk-setup.sh script, built one of the EAL targets and set up hugepages (if using one of the Linux EAL targets),
the user can then move on to building and running their application or one of the examples provided.

The examples in the /examples directory provide a good starting point to gain an understanding of the operation of the DPDK.
The following command sequence shows how the helloworld sample application is built and run.
As recommended in Section 4.2.1 , "Logical Core Use by Applications",
the logical core layout of the platform should be determined when selecting a core mask to use for an application.

.. code-block:: console

    cd helloworld/
    make
      CC main.o
      LD helloworld
      INSTALL-APP helloworld
      INSTALL-MAP helloworld.map

    sudo ./build/app/helloworld -l 0-3 -n 3
    [sudo] password for rte:
