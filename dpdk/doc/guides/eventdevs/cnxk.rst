Prerequisites and Compilation procedure
---------------------------------------

   See :doc:`../platform/cnxk` for setup information.


Runtime Config Options
----------------------

- ``Maximum number of in-flight events`` (default ``8192``)

  In **Marvell OCTEON cnxk** the max number of in-flight events are only limited
  by DRAM size, the ``xae_cnt`` devargs parameter is introduced to provide
  upper limit for in-flight events.

  For example::

    -a 0002:0e:00.0,xae_cnt=16384

- ``CN9K Getwork mode``

  CN9K ``single_ws`` devargs parameter is introduced to select single workslot
  mode in SSO and disable the default dual workslot mode.

  For example::

    -a 0002:0e:00.0,single_ws=1

- ``CN10K Getwork mode``

  CN10K supports three getwork prefetch modes no prefetch[0], prefetch
  immediately[1] and delayed prefetch on forward progress event[2].
  The default getwork mode is 2.

  For example::

    -a 0002:0e:00.0,gw_mode=1

- ``Event Group QoS support``

  SSO GGRPs i.e. queue uses DRAM & SRAM buffers to hold in-flight
  events. By default the buffers are assigned to the SSO GGRPs to
  satisfy minimum HW requirements. SSO is free to assign the remaining
  buffers to GGRPs based on a preconfigured threshold.
  We can control the QoS of SSO GGRP by modifying the above mentioned
  thresholds. GGRPs that have higher importance can be assigned higher
  thresholds than the rest. The dictionary format is as follows
  [Qx-TAQ-IAQ][Qz-TAQ-IAQ] expressed in percentages, 0 represents default.

  For example::

    -a 0002:0e:00.0,qos=[1-50-50]

- ``Force Rx Back pressure``

   Force Rx back pressure when same mempool is used across ethernet device
   connected to event device.

   For example::

      -a 0002:0e:00.0,force_rx_bp=1

- ``TIM disable NPA``

  By default chunks are allocated from NPA then TIM can automatically free
  them when traversing the list of chunks. The ``tim_disable_npa`` devargs
  parameter disables NPA and uses software mempool to manage chunks

  For example::

    -a 0002:0e:00.0,tim_disable_npa=1

- ``TIM modify chunk slots``

  The ``tim_chnk_slots`` devargs can be used to modify number of chunk slots.
  Chunks are used to store event timers, a chunk can be visualised as an array
  where the last element points to the next chunk and rest of them are used to
  store events. TIM traverses the list of chunks and enqueues the event timers
  to SSO. The default value is 255 and the max value is 4095.

  For example::

    -a 0002:0e:00.0,tim_chnk_slots=1023

- ``TIM enable arm/cancel statistics``

  The ``tim_stats_ena`` devargs can be used to enable arm and cancel stats of
  event timer adapter.

  For example::

    -a 0002:0e:00.0,tim_stats_ena=1

- ``TIM limit max rings reserved``

  The ``tim_rings_lmt`` devargs can be used to limit the max number of TIM
  rings i.e. event timer adapter reserved on probe. Since, TIM rings are HW
  resources we can avoid starving other applications by not grabbing all the
  rings.

  For example::

    -a 0002:0e:00.0,tim_rings_lmt=5

- ``TIM ring control internal parameters``

  When using multiple TIM rings the ``tim_ring_ctl`` devargs can be used to
  control each TIM rings internal parameters uniquely. The following dict
  format is expected [ring-chnk_slots-disable_npa-stats_ena]. 0 represents
  default values.

  For Example::

    -a 0002:0e:00.0,tim_ring_ctl=[2-1023-1-0]

- ``TIM external clock frequency``

  The ``tim_eclk_freq`` devagrs can be used to pass external clock frequencies
  when external clock source is selected.

  External clock frequencies are mapped as follows::

    RTE_EVENT_TIMER_ADAPTER_EXT_CLK0 = TIM_CLK_SRC_10NS,
    RTE_EVENT_TIMER_ADAPTER_EXT_CLK1 = TIM_CLK_SRC_GPIO,
    RTE_EVENT_TIMER_ADAPTER_EXT_CLK2 = TIM_CLK_SRC_PTP,
    RTE_EVENT_TIMER_ADAPTER_EXT_CLK3 = TIM_CLK_SRC_SYNCE

  The order of frequencies supplied to device args should be GPIO-PTP-SYNCE.

  For Example::

    -a 0002:0e:00.0,tim_eclk_freq=122880000-1000000000-0

Limitations
-----------

Rx adapter support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Using the same mempool for all the ethernet device ports connected to
event device would cause back pressure to be asserted only on the first
ethernet device.
Back pressure is automatically disabled when using same mempool for all the
ethernet devices connected to event device to override this applications can
use `force_rx_bp=1` device arguments.
Using unique mempool per each ethernet device is recommended when they are
connected to event device.
