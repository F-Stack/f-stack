Introduction
============

This document contains instructions for installing and configuring the
Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK) software. It is designed to get customers
up and running quickly and describes how to compile and run a
DPDK application in a FreeBSD application (freebsd) environment, without going
deeply into detail.

For a comprehensive guide to installing and using FreeBSD, the following
handbook is available from the FreeBSD Documentation Project:
`FreeBSD Handbook <http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/index.html>`_.

.. note::

   DPDK is now available as part of the FreeBSD ports collection and as a pre-built package.
   Installing via the ports collection or FreeBSD `pkg` infrastructure is now the recommended
   way to install DPDK on FreeBSD, and is documented in the next chapter, :ref:`install_from_ports`.
