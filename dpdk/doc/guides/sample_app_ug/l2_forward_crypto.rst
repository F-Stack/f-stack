L2 Forwarding with Crypto Sample Application
============================================

The L2 Forwarding with Crypto (l2fwd-crypto) sample application is a simple example of packet processing using
the Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK), in conjunction with the Cryptodev library.

Overview
--------

The L2 Forwarding with Crypto sample application performs a crypto operation (cipher/hash)
specified by the user from command line (or using the default values),
with a crypto device capable of doing that operation,
for each packet that is received on an RX_PORT and performs L2 forwarding.
The destination port is the adjacent port from the enabled portmask, that is,
if the first four ports are enabled (portmask 0xf),
ports 0 and 1 forward into each other, and ports 2 and 3 forward into each other.
Also, if MAC addresses updating is enabled, the MAC addresses are affected as follows:

*   The source MAC address is replaced by the TX_PORT MAC address

*   The destination MAC address is replaced by  02:00:00:00:00:TX_PORT_ID

Compiling the Application
-------------------------

To compile the sample application see :doc:`compiling`.

The application is located in the ``l2fwd-crypto`` sub-directory.

The application requires that crypto devices capable of performing
the specified crypto operation are available on application initialization.
This means that HW crypto device/s must be bound to a DPDK driver or
a SW crypto device/s (virtual crypto PMD) must be created (using --vdev).

To run the application in linux environment with 2 lcores, 2 ports and 2 crypto devices, issue the command:

.. code-block:: console

    $ ./<build_dir>/examples/dpdk-l2fwd-crypto -l 0-1 --vdev "crypto_aesni_mb0" \
    --vdev "crypto_aesni_mb1" -- -p 0x3 --chain CIPHER_HASH \
    --cipher_op ENCRYPT --cipher_algo aes-cbc \
    --cipher_key 00:01:02:03:04:05:06:07:08:09:0a:0b:0c:0d:0e:0f \
    --auth_op GENERATE --auth_algo aes-xcbc-mac \
    --auth_key 10:11:12:13:14:15:16:17:18:19:1a:1b:1c:1d:1e:1f

Refer to the *DPDK Getting Started Guide* for general information on running applications
and the Environment Abstraction Layer (EAL) options.

.. Note::

    * The ``l2fwd-crypto`` sample application requires IPv4 packets for crypto operation.

    * If multiple Ethernet ports are passed, then equal number of crypto devices are to be passed.

    * All crypto devices shall use the same session.

Explanation
-----------

The L2 forward with Crypto application demonstrates the performance of a crypto operation
on a packet received on an RX PORT before forwarding it to a TX PORT.

The following figure illustrates a sample flow of a packet in the application,
from reception until transmission.

   Encryption flow through the L2 Forwarding with Crypto Application


The following sections provide some explanation of the application.

Crypto operation specification
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All the packets received in all the ports get transformed by the crypto device/s
(ciphering and/or authentication).
The crypto operation to be performed on the packet is parsed from the command line.
(Go to "Running the Application" section for all the options.)

If no parameter is passed, the default crypto operation is:

* Encryption with AES-CBC with 128 bit key.

* Authentication with SHA1-HMAC (generation).

* Keys, IV and AAD are generated randomly.

There are two methods to pass keys, IV and ADD from the command line:

* Passing the full key, separated bytes by ":"::

   --cipher_key 00:11:22:33:44

* Passing the size, so key is generated randomly::

   --cipher_key_random_size 16

**Note**:
   If full key is passed (first method) and the size is passed as well (second method),
   the latter will be ignored.

Size of these keys are checked (regardless the method), before starting the app,
to make sure that it is supported by the crypto devices.

Crypto device initialization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once the encryption operation is defined, crypto devices are initialized.
The crypto devices must be either bound to a DPDK driver (if they are physical devices)
or created using the EAL option --vdev (if they are virtual devices),
when running the application.

The initialize_cryptodevs() function performs the device initialization.
It iterates through the list of the available crypto devices and
checks which ones are capable of performing the operation.
Each device has a set of capabilities associated with it,
which are stored in the device info structure, so the function checks if the operation
is within the structure of each device.

The following code checks if the device supports the specified cipher algorithm
(similar for the authentication algorithm):

.. literalinclude:: ../../../examples/l2fwd-crypto/main.c
    :language: c
    :start-after: Check if device supports cipher algo. 8<
    :end-before: >8 End of check if device supports cipher algo.
    :dedent: 2

If a capable crypto device is found, key sizes are checked to see if they are supported
(cipher key and IV for the ciphering):

.. literalinclude:: ../../../examples/l2fwd-crypto/main.c
    :language: c
    :start-after: Check if capable cipher is supported. 8<
    :end-before: >8 End of checking if cipher is supported.
    :dedent: 2

After all the checks, the device is configured and it is added to the
crypto device list.

**Note**:
   The number of crypto devices that supports the specified crypto operation
   must be at least the number of ports to be used.

Session creation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The crypto operation has a crypto session associated to it, which contains
information such as the transform chain to perform (e.g. ciphering then hashing),
pointers to the keys, lengths... etc.

This session is created and is later attached to the crypto operation:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../examples/l2fwd-crypto/main.c
    :language: c
    :start-after: Session is created and is later attached to the crypto operation. 8<
    :end-before: >8 End of creation of session.

Crypto operation creation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Given N packets received from an RX PORT, N crypto operations are allocated
and filled:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../examples/l2fwd-crypto/main.c
    :language: c
    :start-after: Allocate and fillcrypto operations. 8<
    :end-before: >8 End of crypto operation allocated and filled.
    :dedent: 3

After filling the crypto operation (including session attachment),
the mbuf which will be transformed is attached to it::

   op->sym->m_src = m;

Since no destination mbuf is set, the source mbuf will be overwritten
after the operation is done (in-place).

Crypto operation enqueuing/dequeuing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once the operation has been created, it has to be enqueued in one of the crypto devices.
Before doing so, for performance reasons, the operation stays in a buffer.
When the buffer has enough operations (MAX_PKT_BURST), they are enqueued in the device,
which will perform the operation at that moment:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../examples/l2fwd-crypto/main.c
    :language: c
    :start-after: Crypto enqueue. 8<
    :end-before: >8 End of crypto enqueue.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../examples/l2fwd-crypto/main.c
    :language: c
    :start-after: l2fwd_crypto_send_burst 8<
    :end-before: >8 End of l2fwd_crypto_send_burst.

After this, the operations are dequeued from the device, and the transformed mbuf
is extracted from the operation. Then, the operation is freed and the mbuf is
forwarded as it is done in the L2 forwarding application.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../examples/l2fwd-crypto/main.c
    :language: c
    :start-after: Dequeue packets from Crypto device. 8<
    :end-before: >8 End of dequeue packets from crypto device.
    :dedent: 3
