IPsec Security Gateway Sample Application
=========================================

The IPsec Security Gateway application is an example of a "real world"
application using DPDK cryptodev framework.

Overview
--------

The application demonstrates the implementation of a Security Gateway
(not IPsec compliant, see the Constraints section below) using DPDK based on RFC4301,
RFC4303, RFC3602 and RFC2404.

Internet Key Exchange (IKE) is not implemented, so only manual setting of
Security Policies and Security Associations is supported.

The Security Policies (SP) are implemented as ACL rules, the Security
Associations (SA) are stored in a table and the routing is implemented
using LPM.

The application classifies the ports as *Protected* and *Unprotected*.
Thus, traffic received on an Unprotected or Protected port is consider
Inbound or Outbound respectively.

The application also supports complete IPsec protocol offload to hardware
(Look aside crypto accelerator or using ethernet device). It also support
inline ipsec processing by the supported ethernet device during transmission.
These modes can be selected during the SA creation configuration.

In case of complete protocol offload, the processing of headers(ESP and outer
IP header) is done by the hardware and the application does not need to
add/remove them during outbound/inbound processing.

For inline offloaded outbound traffic, the application will not do the LPM
lookup for routing, as the port on which the packet has to be forwarded will be
part of the SA. Security parameters will be configured on that port only, and
sending the packet on other ports could result in unencrypted packets being
sent out.

The Path for IPsec Inbound traffic is:

*  Read packets from the port.
*  Classify packets between IPv4 and ESP.
*  Perform Inbound SA lookup for ESP packets based on their SPI.
*  Perform Verification/Decryption (Not needed in case of inline ipsec).
*  Remove ESP and outer IP header (Not needed in case of protocol offload).
*  Inbound SP check using ACL of decrypted packets and any other IPv4 packets.
*  Routing.
*  Write packet to port.

The Path for the IPsec Outbound traffic is:

*  Read packets from the port.
*  Perform Outbound SP check using ACL of all IPv4 traffic.
*  Perform Outbound SA lookup for packets that need IPsec protection.
*  Add ESP and outer IP header (Not needed in case protocol offload).
*  Perform Encryption/Digest (Not needed in case of inline ipsec).
*  Routing.
*  Write packet to port.


Constraints
-----------

*  No IPv6 options headers.
*  No AH mode.
*  Supported algorithms: AES-CBC, AES-CTR, AES-GCM, 3DES-CBC, HMAC-SHA1 and NULL.
*  Each SA must be handle by a unique lcore (*1 RX queue per port*).
*  No chained mbufs.

Compiling the Application
-------------------------

To compile the sample application see :doc:`compiling`.

The application is located in the ``rpsec-secgw`` sub-directory.

#. [Optional] Build the application for debugging:
   This option adds some extra flags, disables compiler optimizations and
   is verbose::

       make DEBUG=1


Running the Application
-----------------------

The application has a number of command line options::


   ./build/ipsec-secgw [EAL options] --
                        -p PORTMASK -P -u PORTMASK -j FRAMESIZE
                        --config (port,queue,lcore)[,(port,queue,lcore]
                        --single-sa SAIDX
                        -f CONFIG_FILE_PATH

Where:

*   ``-p PORTMASK``: Hexadecimal bitmask of ports to configure.

*   ``-P``: *optional*. Sets all ports to promiscuous mode so that packets are
    accepted regardless of the packet's Ethernet MAC destination address.
    Without this option, only packets with the Ethernet MAC destination address
    set to the Ethernet address of the port are accepted (default is enabled).

*   ``-u PORTMASK``: hexadecimal bitmask of unprotected ports

*   ``-j FRAMESIZE``: *optional*. Enables jumbo frames with the maximum size
    specified as FRAMESIZE. If an invalid value is provided as FRAMESIZE
    then the default value 9000 is used.

*   ``--config (port,queue,lcore)[,(port,queue,lcore)]``: determines which queues
    from which ports are mapped to which cores.

*   ``--single-sa SAIDX``: use a single SA for outbound traffic, bypassing the SP
    on both Inbound and Outbound. This option is meant for debugging/performance
    purposes.

*   ``-f CONFIG_FILE_PATH``: the full path of text-based file containing all
    configuration items for running the application (See Configuration file
    syntax section below). ``-f CONFIG_FILE_PATH`` **must** be specified.
    **ONLY** the UNIX format configuration file is accepted.


The mapping of lcores to port/queues is similar to other l3fwd applications.

For example, given the following command line::

    ./build/ipsec-secgw -l 20,21 -n 4 --socket-mem 0,2048       \
           --vdev "crypto_null" -- -p 0xf -P -u 0x3      \
           --config="(0,0,20),(1,0,20),(2,0,21),(3,0,21)"       \
           -f /path/to/config_file                              \

where each options means:

*   The ``-l`` option enables cores 20 and 21.

*   The ``-n`` option sets memory 4 channels.

*   The ``--socket-mem`` to use 2GB on socket 1.

*   The ``--vdev "crypto_null"`` option creates virtual NULL cryptodev PMD.

*   The ``-p`` option enables ports (detected) 0, 1, 2 and 3.

*   The ``-P`` option enables promiscuous mode.

*   The ``-u`` option sets ports 1 and 2 as unprotected, leaving 2 and 3 as protected.

*   The ``--config`` option enables one queue per port with the following mapping:

    +----------+-----------+-----------+---------------------------------------+
    | **Port** | **Queue** | **lcore** | **Description**                       |
    |          |           |           |                                       |
    +----------+-----------+-----------+---------------------------------------+
    | 0        | 0         | 20        | Map queue 0 from port 0 to lcore 20.  |
    |          |           |           |                                       |
    +----------+-----------+-----------+---------------------------------------+
    | 1        | 0         | 20        | Map queue 0 from port 1 to lcore 20.  |
    |          |           |           |                                       |
    +----------+-----------+-----------+---------------------------------------+
    | 2        | 0         | 21        | Map queue 0 from port 2 to lcore 21.  |
    |          |           |           |                                       |
    +----------+-----------+-----------+---------------------------------------+
    | 3        | 0         | 21        | Map queue 0 from port 3 to lcore 21.  |
    |          |           |           |                                       |
    +----------+-----------+-----------+---------------------------------------+

*   The ``-f /path/to/config_file`` option enables the application read and
    parse the configuration file specified, and configures the application
    with a given set of SP, SA and Routing entries accordingly. The syntax of
    the configuration file will be explained below in more detail. Please
    **note** the parser only accepts UNIX format text file. Other formats
    such as DOS/MAC format will cause a parse error.

Refer to the *DPDK Getting Started Guide* for general information on running
applications and the Environment Abstraction Layer (EAL) options.

The application would do a best effort to "map" crypto devices to cores, with
hardware devices having priority. Basically, hardware devices if present would
be assigned to a core before software ones.
This means that if the application is using a single core and both hardware
and software crypto devices are detected, hardware devices will be used.

A way to achieve the case where you want to force the use of virtual crypto
devices is to whitelist the Ethernet devices needed and therefore implicitly
blacklisting all hardware crypto devices.

For example, something like the following command line:

.. code-block:: console

    ./build/ipsec-secgw -l 20,21 -n 4 --socket-mem 0,2048 \
            -w 81:00.0 -w 81:00.1 -w 81:00.2 -w 81:00.3 \
            --vdev "crypto_aesni_mb" --vdev "crypto_null" \
	    -- \
            -p 0xf -P -u 0x3 --config="(0,0,20),(1,0,20),(2,0,21),(3,0,21)" \
            -f sample.cfg


Configurations
--------------

The following sections provide the syntax of configurations to initialize
your SP, SA and Routing tables.
Configurations shall be specified in the configuration file to be passed to
the application. The file is then parsed by the application. The successful
parsing will result in the appropriate rules being applied to the tables
accordingly.


Configuration File Syntax
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As mention in the overview, the Security Policies are ACL rules.
The application parsers the rules specified in the configuration file and
passes them to the ACL table, and replicates them per socket in use.

Following are the configuration file syntax.

General rule syntax
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The parse treats one line in the configuration file as one configuration
item (unless the line concatenation symbol exists). Every configuration
item shall follow the syntax of either SP, SA, or Routing rules specified
below.

The configuration parser supports the following special symbols:

 * Comment symbol **#**. Any character from this symbol to the end of
   line is treated as comment and will not be parsed.

 * Line concatenation symbol **\\**. This symbol shall be placed in the end
   of the line to be concatenated to the line below. Multiple lines'
   concatenation is supported.


SP rule syntax
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The SP rule syntax is shown as follows:
