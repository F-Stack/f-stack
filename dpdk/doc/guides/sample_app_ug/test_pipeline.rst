Test Pipeline Application
=========================

The Test Pipeline application illustrates the use of the DPDK Packet Framework tool suite.
Its purpose is to demonstrate the performance of single-table DPDK pipelines.

Overview
--------

The application uses three CPU cores:

*   Core A ("RX core") receives traffic from the NIC ports and feeds core B with traffic through SW queues.

*   Core B ("Pipeline core") implements a single-table DPDK pipeline
    whose type is selectable through specific command line parameter.
    Core B receives traffic from core A through software queues,
    processes it according to the actions configured in the table entries that
    are hit by the input packets and feeds it to core C through another set of software queues.

*   Core C ("TX core") receives traffic from core B through software queues and sends it to the NIC ports for transmission.

   Test Pipeline Application

Compiling the Application
-------------------------
To compile the sample application see :doc:`compiling`

The application is located in the ``$RTE_SDK/test/test-pipeline`` directory.


Running the Application
-----------------------

Application Command Line
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The application execution command line is:

.. code-block:: console

    ./test-pipeline [EAL options] -- -p PORTMASK --TABLE_TYPE

The -c or -l EAL CPU coremask/corelist option has to contain exactly 3 CPU cores.
The first CPU core in the core mask is assigned for core A, the second for core B and the third for core C.

The PORTMASK parameter must contain 2 or 4 ports.

Table Types and Behavior
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:numref:`table_test_pipeline_1` describes the table types used and how they are populated.

The hash tables are pre-populated with 16 million keys.
For hash tables, the following parameters can be selected:

*   **Configurable key size implementation or fixed (specialized) key size implementation (e.g. hash-8-ext or hash-spec-8-ext).**
    The key size specialized implementations are expected to provide better performance for 8-byte and 16-byte key sizes,
    while the key-size-non-specialized implementation is expected to provide better performance for larger key sizes;

*   **Key size (e.g. hash-spec-8-ext or hash-spec-16-ext).**
    The available options are 8, 16 and 32 bytes;

*   **Table type (e.g. hash-spec-16-ext or hash-spec-16-lru).**
    The available options are ext (extendable bucket) or lru (least recently used).

Input Traffic
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Regardless of the table type used for the core B pipeline,
the same input traffic can be used to hit all table entries with uniform distribution,
which results in uniform distribution of packets sent out on the set of output NIC ports.
The profile for input traffic is TCP/IPv4 packets with:

*   destination IP address as A.B.C.D with A fixed to 0 and B, C,D random

*   source IP address fixed to 0.0.0.0

*   destination TCP port fixed to 0

*   source TCP port fixed to 0
