    cnxk Resource virtualization architecture and provisioning example


Resource Virtualization Unit (RVU) on Marvell's OCTEON CN9K/CN10K SoC maps HW
resources belonging to the network, crypto and other functional blocks onto
PCI-compatible physical and virtual functions.

Each functional block has multiple local functions (LFs) for
provisioning to different PCIe devices. RVU supports multiple PCIe SRIOV
physical functions (PFs) and virtual functions (VFs).

The :numref:`table_cnxk_rvu_dpdk_mapping` shows the various local
functions (LFs) provided by the RVU and its functional mapping to
DPDK subsystem.

PF0 is called the administrative / admin function (AF) and has exclusive
privileges to provision RVU functional block's LFs to each of the PF/VF.

PF/VFs communicates with AF via a shared memory region (mailbox).Upon receiving
requests from PF/VF, AF does resource provisioning and other HW configuration.

AF is always attached to host, but PF/VFs may be used by host kernel itself,
or attached to VMs or to userspace applications like DPDK, etc. So, AF has to
handle provisioning/configuration requests sent by any device from any domain.

The AF driver does not receive or process any data.
It is only a configuration driver used in control path.

The :numref:`figure_cnxk_resource_virtualization` diagram also shows a
resource provisioning example where,

1. PFx and PFx-VF0 bound to Linux netdev driver.
2. PFx-VF1 ethdev driver bound to the first DPDK application.
3. PFy ethdev driver, PFy-VF0 ethdev driver, PFz eventdev driver, PFm-VF0 cryptodev driver bound to the second DPDK application.

LBK HW Access
-------------

Loopback HW Unit (LBK) receives packets from NIX-RX and sends packets back to NIX-TX.
The loopback block has N channels and contains data buffering that is shared across
all channels. The LBK HW Unit is abstracted using ethdev subsystem, Where PF0's
VFs are exposed as ethdev device and odd-even pairs of VFs are tied together,
that is, packets sent on odd VF end up received on even VF and vice versa.
This would enable HW accelerated means of communication between two domains
where even VF bound to the first domain and odd VF bound to the second domain.

Typical application usage models are,

#. Communication between the Linux kernel and DPDK application.

#. Exception path to Linux kernel from DPDK application as SW ``KNI`` replacement.

#. Communication between two different DPDK applications.

SDP interface
-------------

System DPI Packet Interface unit(SDP) provides PCIe endpoint support for remote host
to DMA packets into and out of cnxk SoC. SDP interface comes in to live only when
cnxk SoC is connected in PCIe endpoint mode. It can be used to send/receive
packets to/from remote host machine using input/output queue pairs exposed to it.
SDP interface receives input packets from remote host from NIX-RX and sends packets
to remote host using NIX-TX. Remote host machine need to use corresponding driver
(kernel/user mode) to communicate with SDP interface on cnxk SoC. SDP supports
single PCIe SRIOV physical function(PF) and multiple virtual functions(VF's). Users
can bind PF or VF to use SDP interface and it will be enumerated as ethdev ports.

The primary use case for SDP is to enable the smart NIC use case. Typical usage models are,

#. Communication channel between remote host and cnxk SoC over PCIe.

#. Transfer packets received from network interface to remote host over PCIe and
   vice-versa.

cnxk packet flow

The :numref:`figure_cnxk_packet_flow_hw_accelerators` diagram depicts
the packet flow on cnxk SoC in conjunction with use of various HW accelerators.

Procedure to Setup Platform
---------------------------

There are three main prerequisites for setting up DPDK on cnxk
compatible board:

1. **RVU AF Linux kernel driver**

   The dependent kernel drivers can be obtained from the
   `kernel.org <https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/drivers/net/ethernet/marvell/octeontx2>`_.

   Alternatively, the Marvell SDK also provides the required kernel drivers.

   Linux kernel should be configured with the following features enabled:

.. code-block:: console

        # 64K pages enabled for better performance
        CONFIG_ARM64_64K_PAGES=y
        CONFIG_ARM64_VA_BITS_48=y
        # huge pages support enabled
        CONFIG_HUGETLBFS=y
        CONFIG_HUGETLB_PAGE=y
        # VFIO enabled with TYPE1 IOMMU at minimum
        CONFIG_VFIO_IOMMU_TYPE1=y
        CONFIG_VFIO_VIRQFD=y
        CONFIG_VFIO=y
        CONFIG_VFIO_NOIOMMU=y
        CONFIG_VFIO_PCI=y
        CONFIG_VFIO_PCI_MMAP=y
        # SMMUv3 driver
        CONFIG_ARM_SMMU_V3=y
        # ARMv8.1 LSE atomics
        CONFIG_ARM64_LSE_ATOMICS=y
        # OCTEONTX2 drivers
        CONFIG_OCTEONTX2_MBOX=y
        CONFIG_OCTEONTX2_AF=y
        # Enable if netdev PF driver required
        CONFIG_OCTEONTX2_PF=y
        # Enable if netdev VF driver required
        CONFIG_OCTEONTX2_VF=y
        CONFIG_CRYPTO_DEV_OCTEONTX2_CPT=y
        # Enable if OCTEONTX2 DMA PF driver required
        CONFIG_OCTEONTX2_DPI_PF=n

2. **ARM64 Linux Tool Chain**

   For example, the *aarch64* Linaro Toolchain, which can be obtained from
   `here <https://releases.linaro.org/components/toolchain/binaries/7.4-2019.02/aarch64-linux-gnu/>`_.

   Alternatively, the Marvell SDK also provides GNU GCC toolchain, which is
   optimized for cnxk CPU.

3. **Rootfile system**

   Any *aarch64* supporting filesystem may be used. For example,
   Ubuntu 15.10 (Wily) or 16.04 LTS (Xenial) userland which can be obtained
   from `<http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-base/releases/16.04/release/ubuntu-base-16.04.1-base-arm64.tar.gz>`_.

   Alternatively, the Marvell SDK provides the buildroot based root filesystem.
   The SDK includes all the above prerequisites necessary to bring up the cnxk board.

- Follow the DPDK :doc:`../linux_gsg/index` to setup the basic DPDK environment.

   | 2 | Mailbox    | --log-level='pmd\.cnxk\.mbox,8'                       |
   +---+------------+-------------------------------------------------------+

Debugfs support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The **RVU AF Linux kernel driver** provides support to dump RVU blocks
context or stats using debugfs.

Enable ``debugfs`` by:

1. Compile kernel with debugfs enabled, i.e ``CONFIG_DEBUG_FS=y``.
2. Boot OCTEON CN9K/CN10K with debugfs supported kernel.
3. Verify ``debugfs`` mounted by default "mount | grep -i debugfs" or mount it manually by using.

.. code-block:: console

       # mount -t debugfs none /sys/kernel/debug

Currently ``debugfs`` supports the following RVU blocks NIX, NPA, NPC, NDC,
SSO & RPM.

The file structure under ``/sys/kernel/debug`` is as follows

.. code-block:: console

Compile DPDK
------------

DPDK may be compiled either natively on OCTEON CN9K/CN10K platform or cross-compiled on
an x86 based platform.
Meson build option ``enable_iova_as_pa`` is disabled on CNXK platforms.
So only PMDs supporting this option are enabled on CNXK platform builds.

Native Compilation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Refer to :doc:`../linux_gsg/build_dpdk` for generic native builds.

CN9K:

.. code-block:: console

        meson setup -Dplatform=cn9k build
        ninja -C build

CN10K:

.. code-block:: console

        meson setup -Dplatform=cn10k build
        ninja -C build

Cross Compilation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Refer to :doc:`../linux_gsg/cross_build_dpdk_for_arm64` for generic arm64 details.

CN9K:

.. code-block:: console

        meson setup build --cross-file config/arm/arm64_cn9k_linux_gcc
        ninja -C build

CN10K:

.. code-block:: console

        meson setup build --cross-file config/arm/arm64_cn10k_linux_gcc
        ninja -C build

.. note::

   By default, meson cross compilation uses ``aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc`` toolchain,
   if Marvell toolchain is available then it can be used by overriding the
   c, cpp, ar, strip ``binaries`` attributes to respective Marvell
   toolchain binaries in ``config/arm/arm64_cn10k_linux_gcc`` file.

Environment Variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* ``BPHY_INTR_MLOCK_DISABLE``
   When defined disables memory locking in
   BPHY environment.

* ``ROC_CN10K_MBOX_TIMEOUT``, ``ROC_MBOX_TIMEOUT``
   When set, overrides MBOX timeout by value in milli seconds.

* ``ETH_SEC_IV_OVR``
   When set, overrides outbound inline SA IV. By default IV is generated
   by HW. Format of variable is string of comma separated one byte values as
   for ex: "0x0, 0x10, 0x20, ..."
