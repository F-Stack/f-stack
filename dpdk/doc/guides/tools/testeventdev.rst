dpdk-test-eventdev Application
==============================

The ``dpdk-test-eventdev`` tool is a Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK)
application that allows exercising various eventdev use cases.
This application has a generic framework to add new eventdev based test cases to
verify functionality and measure the performance parameters of DPDK eventdev
devices.

Compiling the Application
-------------------------

**Build the application**

Execute the ``dpdk-setup.sh`` script to build the DPDK library together with the
``dpdk-test-eventdev`` application.

Initially, the user must select a DPDK target to choose the correct target type
and compiler options to use when building the libraries.
The user must have all libraries, modules, updates and compilers installed
in the system prior to this,
as described in the earlier chapters in this Getting Started Guide.

Running the Application
-----------------------

The application has a number of command line options:

.. code-block:: console

   dpdk-test-eventdev [EAL Options] -- [application options]

EAL Options
~~~~~~~~~~~

The following are the EAL command-line options that can be used in conjunction
with the ``dpdk-test-eventdev`` application.
See the DPDK Getting Started Guides for more information on these options.

*   ``-c <COREMASK>`` or ``-l <CORELIST>``

        Set the hexadecimal bitmask of the cores to run on. The corelist is a
        list of cores to use.

*   ``--vdev <driver><id>``

        Add a virtual eventdev device.

Application Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following are the application command-line options:

* ``--verbose``

        Set verbose level. Default is 1. Value > 1 displays more details.

* ``--dev <n>``

        Set the device id of the event device.

* ``--test <name>``

        Set test name, where ``name`` is one of the following::

         order_queue
         order_atq

            P or p : Parallel schedule type
            O or o : Ordered schedule type
            A or a : Atomic schedule type

.. _figure_eventdev_order_queue_test:

.. figure:: img/eventdev_order_queue_test.*

   order queue test operation.

The order queue test configures the eventdev with two queues and an event
producer to inject the events to q0(ordered) queue. Both q0(ordered) and
q1(atomic) are linked to all the workers.

The event producer maintains a sequence number per flow and injects the events
to the ordered queue. The worker receives the events from ordered queue and
forwards to atomic queue. Since the events from an ordered queue can be
processed in parallel on the different workers, the ingress order of events
might have changed on the downstream atomic queue enqueue. On enqueue to the
atomic queue, the eventdev PMD driver reorders the event to the original
ingress order(i.e producer ingress order).

When the event is dequeued from the atomic queue by the worker, this test
verifies the expected sequence number of associated event per flow by comparing
the free running expected sequence number per flow.

.. _figure_eventdev_perf_queue_test:

.. figure:: img/eventdev_perf_queue_test.*

   perf queue test operation.

The perf queue test configures the eventdev with Q queues and P ports, where
Q and P is a function of the number of workers, the number of producers and
number of stages as mentioned in :numref:`table_eventdev_perf_queue_test`.

The user can choose the number of workers, the number of producers and number of
stages through the ``--wlcores``, ``--plcores`` and the ``--stlist`` application
command line arguments respectively.

The producer(s) injects the events to eventdev based the first stage sched type
list requested by the user through ``--stlist`` the command line argument.

Based on the number of stages to process(selected through ``--stlist``),
The application forwards the event to next upstream queue and terminates when it
reaches the last stage in the pipeline. On event termination, application
increments the number events processed and print periodically in one second
to get the number of events processed in one second.

When ``--fwd_latency`` command line option selected, the application inserts
the timestamp in the event on the first stage and then on termination, it
updates the number of cycles to forward a packet. The application uses this
value to compute the average latency to a forward packet.

When ``--prod_type_ethdev`` command line option is selected, the application
uses the probed ethernet devices as producers by configuring them as Rx
adapters instead of using synthetic producers.

   perf all types queue test operation.


The ``all types queues(atq)`` perf test configures the eventdev with Q queues
and P ports, where Q and P is a function of the number of workers and number of
producers as mentioned in :numref:`table_eventdev_perf_atq_test`.


The atq queue test functions as same as ``perf_queue`` test. The difference
is, It uses, ``all type queue scheme`` instead of separate queues for each
stage and thus reduces the number of queues required to realize the use case
and enables flow pinning as the event does not move to the next queue.

   pipeline queue test operation.

The pipeline queue test configures the eventdev with Q queues and P ports,
where Q and P is a function of the number of workers, the number of producers
and number of stages as mentioned in :numref:`table_eventdev_pipeline_queue_test`.

The user can choose the number of workers and number of stages through the
``--wlcores`` and the ``--stlist`` application command line arguments
respectively.

The number of producers depends on the number of ethernet devices detected and
each ethernet device is configured as a event_eth_rx_adapter that acts as a
producer.

The producer(s) injects the events to eventdev based the first stage sched type
list requested by the user through ``--stlist`` the command line argument.

Based on the number of stages to process(selected through ``--stlist``),
The application forwards the event to next upstream queue and when it reaches
the last stage in the pipeline if the event type is ``atomic`` it is enqueued
onto ethdev Tx queue else to maintain ordering the event type is set to
``atomic`` and enqueued onto the last stage queue.

If the ethdev and eventdev pair have ``RTE_EVENT_ETH_TX_ADAPTER_CAP_INTERNAL_PORT``
capability then the worker cores enqueue the packets to the eventdev directly
using ``rte_event_eth_tx_adapter_enqueue`` else the worker cores enqueue the
packet onto the ``SINGLE_LINK_QUEUE`` that is managed by the Tx adapter.
The Tx adapter dequeues the packet and transmits it.

On packet Tx, application increments the number events processed and print
periodically in one second to get the number of events processed in one
second.

PIPELINE_ATQ Test
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a pipeline test case that aims at testing the following with
``all types queue`` eventdev scheme.

#. Measure the end-to-end performance of an event dev with a ethernet dev.
#. Maintain packet ordering from Rx to Tx.

   pipeline atq test operation.

The pipeline atq test configures the eventdev with Q queues and P ports,
where Q and P is a function of the number of workers, the number of producers
and number of stages as mentioned in :numref:`table_eventdev_pipeline_atq_test`.

The atq queue test functions as same as ``pipeline_queue`` test. The difference
is, It uses, ``all type queue scheme`` instead of separate queues for each
stage and thus reduces the number of queues required to realize the use case.
