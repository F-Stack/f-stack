dpdk-procinfo Application
=========================

The dpdk-procinfo application is a Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK) application
that runs as a DPDK secondary process and is capable of retrieving port
statistics, resetting port statistics and printing DPDK memory information.
This application extends the original functionality that was supported by
dump_cfg.

Running the Application
-----------------------
The application has a number of command line options:

.. code-block:: console

   ./$(RTE_TARGET)/app/dpdk-procinfo -- -m | [-p PORTMASK] [--stats | --xstats |
   --stats-reset | --xstats-reset]

Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~
**-p PORTMASK**: Hexadecimal bitmask of ports to configure.

**--stats**
The stats parameter controls the printing of generic port statistics. If no
port mask is specified stats are printed for all DPDK ports.

**--xstats**
The xstats parameter controls the printing of extended port statistics. If no
port mask is specified xstats are printed for all DPDK ports.

**--stats-reset**
The stats-reset parameter controls the resetting of generic port statistics. If
no port mask is specified, the generic stats are reset for all DPDK ports.

**--xstats-reset**
The xstats-reset parameter controls the resetting of extended port statistics.
If no port mask is specified xstats are reset for all DPDK ports.

**-m**: Print DPDK memory information.
