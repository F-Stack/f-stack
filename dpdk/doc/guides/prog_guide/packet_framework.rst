Packet Framework
================

Design Objectives
-----------------

The main design objectives for the DPDK Packet Framework are:

*   Provide standard methodology to build complex packet processing pipelines.
    Provide reusable and extensible templates for the commonly used pipeline functional blocks;

*   Provide capability to switch between pure software and hardware-accelerated implementations for the same pipeline functional block;

*   Provide the best trade-off between flexibility and performance.
    Hardcoded pipelines usually provide the best performance, but are not flexible,
    while developing flexible frameworks is never a problem, but performance is usually low;

*   Provide a framework that is logically similar to Open Flow.

Overview
--------

Packet processing applications are frequently structured as pipelines of multiple stages,
with the logic of each stage glued around a lookup table.
For each incoming packet, the table defines the set of actions to be applied to the packet,
as well as the next stage to send the packet to.

The DPDK Packet Framework minimizes the development effort required to build packet processing pipelines
by defining a standard methodology for pipeline development,
as well as providing libraries of reusable templates for the commonly used pipeline blocks.

The pipeline is constructed by connecting the set of input ports with the set of output ports
through the set of tables in a tree-like topology.
As result of lookup operation for the current packet in the current table,
one of the table entries (on lookup hit) or the default table entry (on lookup miss)
provides the set of actions to be applied on the current packet,
as well as the next hop for the packet, which can be either another table, an output port or packet drop.

An example of packet processing pipeline is presented in :numref:`figure_figure32`:

Port Interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each port is unidirectional, i.e. either input port or output port.
Each input/output port is required to implement an abstract interface that
defines the initialization and run-time operation of the port.
The port abstract interface is described in.

Hash Table Design
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Hash Table Overview
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Hash tables are important because the key lookup operation is optimized for speed:
instead of having to linearly search the lookup key through all the keys in the table,
the search is limited to only the keys stored in a single table bucket.

**Associative Arrays**

An associative array is a function that can be specified as a set of (key, value) pairs,
with each key from the possible set of input keys present at most once.
For a given associative array, the possible operations are:

#.  *add (key, value)*: When no value is currently associated with *key*, then the (key, *value* ) association is created.
    When *key* is already associated value *value0*, then the association (*key*, *value0*) is removed
    and association *(key, value)* is created;

#.  *delete key*: When no value is currently associated with *key*, this operation has no effect.
    When *key* is already associated  *value*, then association  *(key, value)* is removed;

#.  *lookup key*: When no value is currently associated with  *key*, then this operation returns void value (lookup miss).
    When *key* is associated with *value*, then this operation returns *value*.
    The *(key, value)* association is not changed.

The matching criterion used to compare the input key against the keys in the associative array is *exact match*,
as the key size (number of bytes) and the key value (array of bytes) have to match exactly for the two keys under comparison.

**Hash Function**

A hash function deterministically maps data of variable length (key) to data of fixed size (hash value or key signature).
Typically, the size of the key is bigger than the size of the key signature.
The hash function basically compresses a long key into a short signature.
Several keys can share the same signature (collisions).

High quality hash functions have uniform distribution.
For large number of keys, when dividing the space of signature values into a fixed number of equal intervals (buckets),
it is desirable to have the key signatures evenly distributed across these intervals (uniform distribution),
as opposed to most of the signatures going into only a few of the intervals
and the rest of the intervals being largely unused (non-uniform distribution).

**Hash Table**

A hash table is an associative array that uses a hash function for its operation.
The reason for using a hash function is to optimize the performance of the lookup operation
by minimizing the number of table keys that have to be compared against the input key.

Instead of storing the (key, value) pairs in a single list, the hash table maintains multiple lists (buckets).
For any given key, there is a single bucket where that key might exist, and this bucket is uniquely identified based on the key signature.
Once the key signature is computed and the hash table bucket identified,
the key is either located in this bucket or it is not present in the hash table at all,
so the key search can be narrowed down from the full set of keys currently in the table
to just the set of keys currently in the identified table bucket.

The performance of the hash table lookup operation is greatly improved,
provided that the table keys are evenly distributed among the hash table buckets,
which can be achieved by using a hash function with uniform distribution.
The rule to map a key to its bucket can simply be to use the key signature (modulo the number of table buckets) as the table bucket ID:

    *bucket_id = f_hash(key) % n_buckets;*

By selecting the number of buckets to be a power of two, the modulo operator can be replaced by a bitwise AND logical operation:

    *bucket_id = f_hash(key) & (n_buckets - 1);*

considering *n_bits* as the number of bits set in *bucket_mask = n_buckets - 1*,
this means that all the keys that end up in the same hash table bucket have the lower *n_bits* of their signature identical.
In order to reduce the number of keys in the same bucket (collisions), the number of hash table buckets needs to be increased.

In packet processing context, the sequence of operations involved in hash table operations is described in :numref:`figure_figure33`:

   Sequence of Steps for Hash Table Operations in a Packet Processing Context



Hash Table Use Cases
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Flow Classification**

*Description:* The flow classification is executed at least once for each input packet.
This operation maps each incoming packet against one of the known traffic flows in the flow database that typically contains millions of flows.

*Hash table name:* Flow classification table

*Number of keys:* Millions

*Key format:* n-tuple of packet fields that uniquely identify a traffic flow/connection.
Example: DiffServ 5-tuple of (Source IP address, Destination IP address, L4 protocol, L4 protocol source port, L4 protocol destination port).
For IPv4 protocol and L4 protocols like TCP, UDP or SCTP, the size of the DiffServ 5-tuple is 13 bytes, while for IPv6 it is 37 bytes.

*Key value (key data):* actions and action meta-data describing what processing to be applied for the packets of the current flow.
The size of the data associated with each traffic flow can vary from 8 bytes to kilobytes.

**Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)**

*Description:* Once a route has been identified for an IP packet (so the output interface and the IP address of the next hop station are known),
the MAC address of the next hop station is needed in order to send this packet onto the next leg of the journey
towards its destination (as identified by its destination IP address).
The MAC address of the next hop station becomes the destination MAC address of the outgoing Ethernet frame.

*Hash table name:* ARP table

*Number of keys:* Thousands

*Key format:* The pair of (Output interface, Next Hop IP address), which is typically 5 bytes for IPv4 and 17 bytes for IPv6.

*Key value (key data):* MAC address of the next hop station (6 bytes).

Bucket Full Problem
"""""""""""""""""""

On initialization, each hash table bucket is allocated space for exactly 4 keys.
As keys are added to the table, it can happen that a given bucket already has 4 keys when a new key has to be added to this bucket.
The possible options are:

#.  **Least Recently Used (LRU) Hash Table.**
    One of the existing keys in the bucket is deleted and the new key is added in its place.
    The number of keys in each bucket never grows bigger than 4. The logic to pick the key to be dropped from the bucket is LRU.
    The hash table lookup operation maintains the order in which the keys in the same bucket are hit, so every time a key is hit,
    it becomes the new Most Recently Used (MRU) key, i.e. the last candidate for drop.
    When a key is added to the bucket, it also becomes the new MRU key.
    When a key needs to be picked and dropped, the first candidate for drop, i.e. the current LRU key, is always picked.
    The LRU logic requires maintaining specific data structures per each bucket.

#.  **Extendable Bucket Hash Table.**
    The bucket is extended with space for 4 more keys.
    This is done by allocating additional memory at table initialization time,
    which is used to create a pool of free keys (the size of this pool is configurable and always a multiple of 4).
    On key add operation, the allocation of a group of 4 keys only happens successfully within the limit of free keys,
    otherwise the key add operation fails.
    On key delete operation, a group of 4 keys is freed back to the pool of free keys
    when the key to be deleted is the only key that was used within its group of 4 keys at that time.
    On key lookup operation, if the current bucket is in extended state and a match is not found in the first group of 4 keys,
    the search continues beyond the first group of 4 keys, potentially until all keys in this bucket are examined.
    The extendable bucket logic requires maintaining specific data structures per table and per each bucket.

Signature Computation
"""""""""""""""""""""

The possible options for key signature computation are:

#.  **Pre-computed key signature.**
    The key lookup operation is split between two CPU cores.
    The first CPU core (typically the CPU core that performs packet RX) extracts the key from the input packet,
    computes the key signature and saves both the key and the key signature in the packet buffer as packet meta-data.
    The second CPU core reads both the key and the key signature from the packet meta-data
    and performs the bucket search step of the key lookup operation.

#.  **Key signature computed on lookup ("do-sig" version).**
    The same CPU core reads the key from the packet meta-data, uses it to compute the key signature
    and also performs the bucket search step of the key lookup operation.

Key Size Optimized Hash Tables
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

For specific key sizes, the data structures and algorithm of key lookup operation can be specially handcrafted for further performance improvements,
so following options are possible:

#.  **Implementation supporting configurable key size.**

#.  **Implementation supporting a single key size.**
    Typical key sizes are 8 bytes and 16 bytes.

Bucket Search Logic for Configurable Key Size Hash Tables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The performance of the bucket search logic is one of the main factors influencing the performance of the key lookup operation.
The data structures and algorithm are designed to make the best use of Intel CPU architecture resources like:
cache memory space, cache memory bandwidth, external memory bandwidth, multiple execution units working in parallel,
out of order instruction execution, special CPU instructions, etc.

The bucket search logic handles multiple input packets in parallel.
It is built as a pipeline of several stages (3 or 4), with each pipeline stage handling two different packets from the burst of input packets.
On each pipeline iteration, the packets are pushed to the next pipeline stage: for the 4-stage pipeline,
two packets (that just completed stage 3) exit the pipeline,
two packets (that just completed stage 2) are now executing stage 3, two packets (that just completed stage 1) are now executing stage 2,
two packets (that just completed stage 0) are now executing stage 1 and two packets (next two packets to read from the burst of input packets)
are entering the pipeline to execute stage 0.
The pipeline iterations continue until all packets from the burst of input packets execute the last stage of the pipeline.

The bucket search logic is broken into pipeline stages at the boundary of the next memory access.
Each pipeline stage uses data structures that are stored (with high probability) into the L1 or L2 cache memory of the current CPU core and
breaks just before the next memory access required by the algorithm.
The current pipeline stage finalizes by prefetching the data structures required by the next pipeline stage,
so given enough time for the prefetch to complete,
when the next pipeline stage eventually gets executed for the same packets,
it will read the data structures it needs from L1 or L2 cache memory and thus avoid the significant penalty incurred by L2 or L3 cache memory miss.

By prefetching the data structures required by the next pipeline stage in advance (before they are used)
and switching to executing another pipeline stage for different packets,
the number of L2 or L3 cache memory misses is greatly reduced, hence one of the main reasons for improved performance.
This is because the cost of L2/L3 cache memory miss on memory read accesses is high, as usually due to data dependency between instructions,
the CPU execution units have to stall until the read operation is completed from L3 cache memory or external DRAM memory.
By using prefetch instructions, the latency of memory read accesses is hidden,
provided that it is preformed early enough before the respective data structure is actually used.

By splitting the processing into several stages that are executed on different packets (the packets from the input burst are interlaced),
enough work is created to allow the prefetch instructions to complete successfully (before the prefetched data structures are actually accessed) and
also the data dependency between instructions is loosened.
For example, for the 4-stage pipeline, stage 0 is executed on packets 0 and 1 and then,
before same packets 0 and 1 are used (i.e. before stage 1 is executed on packets 0 and 1),
different packets are used: packets 2 and 3 (executing stage 1), packets 4 and 5 (executing stage 2) and packets 6 and 7 (executing stage 3).
By executing useful work while the data structures are brought into the L1 or L2 cache memory, the latency of the read memory accesses is hidden.
By increasing the gap between two consecutive accesses to the same data structure, the data dependency between instructions is loosened;
this allows making the best use of the super-scalar and out-of-order execution CPU architecture,
as the number of CPU core execution units that are active (rather than idle or stalled due to data dependency constraints between instructions) is maximized.

The bucket search logic is also implemented without using any branch instructions.
This avoids the important cost associated with flushing the CPU core execution pipeline on every instance of branch misprediction.

Additional notes:

#.  The pipelined version of the bucket search algorithm is executed only if there are at least 7 packets in the burst of input packets.
    If there are less than 7 packets in the burst of input packets,
    a non-optimized implementation of the bucket search algorithm is executed.

#.  Once the pipelined version of the bucket search algorithm has been executed for all the packets in the burst of input packets,
    the non-optimized implementation of the bucket search algorithm is also executed for any packets that did not produce a lookup hit,
    but have the *match_many* flag set.
    As result of executing the non-optimized version, some of these packets may produce a lookup hit or lookup miss.
    This does not impact the performance of the key lookup operation,
    as the probability of matching more than one signature in the same group of 4 keys or of having the bucket in extended state
    (for extendable bucket hash tables only) is relatively small.

The input *mask* hash bit X (X = 0 .. 3) set to 1 if input signature is equal to bucket signature X and set to 0 otherwise.
The outputs *match*, *match_many* and *match_pos* are 1 bit, 1 bit and 2 bits in size respectively and their meaning has been explained above.

As displayed in :numref:`table_qos_29`, the lookup tables for *match* and *match_many* can be collapsed into a single 32-bit value and the lookup table for
*match_pos* can be collapsed into a 64-bit value.
Given the input *mask*, the values for *match*, *match_many* and *match_pos* can be obtained by indexing their respective bit array to extract 1 bit,
1 bit and 2 bits respectively with branchless logic.

Additional notes:

#.  The pipelined version of the bucket search algorithm is executed only if there are at least 5 packets in the burst of input packets.
    If there are less than 5 packets in the burst of input packets, a non-optimized implementation of the bucket search algorithm is executed.

#.  For extendable bucket hash tables only,
    once the pipelined version of the bucket search algorithm has been executed for all the packets in the burst of input packets,
    the non-optimized implementation of the bucket search algorithm is also executed for any packets that did not produce a lookup hit,
    but have the bucket in extended state.
    As result of executing the non-optimized version, some of these packets may produce a lookup hit or lookup miss.
    This does not impact the performance of the key lookup operation,
    as the probability of having the bucket in extended state is relatively small.

Pipeline Library Design
-----------------------

A pipeline is defined by:

#.  The set of input ports;

#.  The set of output ports;

#.  The set of tables;

#.  The set of actions.

The input ports are connected with the output ports through tree-like topologies of interconnected tables.
The table entries contain the actions defining the operations to be executed on the input packets and the packet flow within the pipeline.

Connectivity of Ports and Tables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To avoid any dependencies on the order in which pipeline elements are created,
the connectivity of pipeline elements is defined after all the pipeline input ports,
output ports and tables have been created.

General connectivity rules:

#.  Each input port is connected to a single table. No input port should be left unconnected;

#.  The table connectivity to other tables or to output ports is regulated by the next hop actions of each table entry and the default table entry.
    The table connectivity is fluid, as the table entries and the default table entry can be updated during run-time.

    *   A table can have multiple entries (including the default entry) connected to the same output port.
        A table can have different entries connected to different output ports.
        Different tables can have entries (including default table entry) connected to the same output port.

    *   A table can have multiple entries (including the default entry) connected to another table,
        in which case all these entries have to point to the same table.
        This constraint is enforced by the API and prevents tree-like topologies from being created (allowing table chaining only),
        with the purpose of simplifying the implementation of the pipeline run-time execution engine.

Port Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Port Action Handler
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An action handler can be assigned to each input/output port to define actions to be executed on each input packet that is received by the port.
Defining the action handler for a specific input/output port is optional (i.e. the action handler can be disabled).

For input ports, the action handler is executed after RX function. For output ports, the action handler is executed before the TX function.

The action handler can decide to drop packets.

Table Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Table Action Handler
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An action handler to be executed on each input packet can be assigned to each table.
Defining the action handler for a specific table is optional (i.e. the action handler can be disabled).

The action handler is executed after the table lookup operation is performed and the table entry associated with each input packet is identified.
The action handler can only handle the user-defined actions, while the reserved actions (e.g. the next hop actions) are handled by the Packet Framework.
The action handler can decide to drop the input packet.

Reserved Actions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The reserved actions are handled directly by the Packet Framework without the user being able to change their meaning
through the table action handler configuration.
A special category of the reserved actions is represented by the next hop actions, which regulate the packet flow between input ports,
tables and output ports through the pipeline.
:numref:`table_qos_33` lists the next hop actions.

   +---+---------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

User Actions
^^^^^^^^^^^^

For each table, the meaning of user actions is defined through the configuration of the table action handler.
Different tables can be configured with different action handlers, therefore the meaning of the user actions
and their associated meta-data is private to each table.
Within the same table, all the table entries (including the table default entry) share the same definition
for the user actions and their associated meta-data,
with each table entry having its own set of enabled user actions and its own copy of the action meta-data.
:numref:`table_qos_34` contains a non-exhaustive list of user action examples.

Multicore Scaling
-----------------

A complex application is typically split across multiple cores, with cores communicating through SW queues.
There is usually a performance limit on the number of table lookups
and actions that can be fitted on the same CPU core due to HW constraints like:
available CPU cycles, cache memory size, cache transfer BW, memory transfer BW, etc.

As the application is split across multiple CPU cores, the Packet Framework facilitates the creation of several pipelines,
the assignment of each such pipeline to a different CPU core
and the interconnection of all CPU core-level pipelines into a single application-level complex pipeline.
For example, if CPU core A is assigned to run pipeline P1 and CPU core B pipeline P2,
then the interconnection of P1 with P2 could be achieved by having the same set of SW queues act like output ports
for P1 and input ports for P2.

This approach enables the application development using the pipeline, run-to-completion (clustered) or hybrid (mixed) models.

It is allowed for the same core to run several pipelines, but it is not allowed for several cores to run the same pipeline.

Shared Data Structures
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The threads performing table lookup are actually table writers rather than just readers.
Even if the specific table lookup algorithm is thread-safe for multiple readers
(e. g. read-only access of the search algorithm data structures is enough to conduct the lookup operation),
once the table entry for the current packet is identified, the thread is typically expected to update the action meta-data stored in the table entry
(e.g. increment the counter tracking the number of packets that hit this table entry), and thus modify the table entry.
During the time this thread is accessing this table entry (either writing or reading; duration is application specific),
for data consistency reasons, no other threads (threads performing table lookup or entry add/delete operations) are allowed to modify this table entry.

Mechanisms to share the same table between multiple threads:

#.  **Multiple writer threads.**
    Threads need to use synchronization primitives like semaphores (distinct semaphore per table entry) or atomic instructions.
    The cost of semaphores is usually high, even when the semaphore is free.
    The cost of atomic instructions is normally higher than the cost of regular instructions.

#.  **Multiple writer threads, with single thread performing table lookup operations and multiple threads performing table entry add/delete operations.**
    The threads performing table entry add/delete operations send table update requests to the reader (typically through message passing queues),
    which does the actual table updates and then sends the response back to the request initiator.

#.  **Single writer thread performing table entry add/delete operations and multiple reader threads that perform table lookup operations with read-only access to the table entries.**
    The reader threads use the main table copy while the writer is updating the mirror copy.
    Once the writer update is done, the writer can signal to the readers and busy wait until all readers swaps between the mirror copy (which now becomes the main copy) and
    the mirror copy (which now becomes the main copy).

Interfacing with Accelerators
-----------------------------

The presence of accelerators is usually detected during the initialization phase by inspecting the HW devices that are part of the system (e.g. by PCI bus enumeration).
Typical devices with acceleration capabilities are:

*   Inline accelerators: NICs, switches, FPGAs, etc;

*   Look-aside accelerators: chipsets, FPGAs, Intel QuickAssist, etc.

Usually, to support a specific functional block, specific implementation of Packet Framework tables and/or ports and/or actions has to be provided for each accelerator,
with all the implementations sharing the same API: pure SW implementation (no acceleration), implementation using accelerator A, implementation using accelerator B, etc.
The selection between these implementations could be done at build time or at run-time (recommended), based on which accelerators are present in the system,
with no application changes required.
