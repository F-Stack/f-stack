General-Purpose Graphics Processing Unit Library
================================================

When mixing networking activity with task processing on a GPU device,
there may be the need to put in communication the CPU with the device
in order to manage the memory, synchronize operations, exchange info, etc..

By means of the generic GPU interface provided by this library,
it is possible to allocate a chunk of GPU memory and use it
to create a DPDK mempool with external mbufs having the payload
on the GPU memory, enabling any network interface card
supporting this feature
to directly transmit and receive packets using GPU memory.

Additionally, this library provides a number of functions
to enhance the dialog between CPU and GPU.

Out of scope of this library is to provide a wrapper for GPU specific libraries
(e.g. CUDA Toolkit or OpenCL), thus it is not possible to launch workload
on the device or create GPU specific objects
(e.g. CUDA Driver context or CUDA Streams in case of NVIDIA GPUs).

This library is optional in DPDK
and can be disabled with ``-Ddisable_libs=gpudev``.


Features
--------

This library provides a number of features:

- Interoperability with device-specific library through generic handlers.
- Allocate and free memory on the device.
- Register CPU memory to make it visible from the device.
- Communication between the CPU and the device.

The whole CPU - GPU communication is implemented
using CPU memory visible from the GPU.


API Overview
------------

Child Device
~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, DPDK PCIe module detects and registers physical GPU devices
in the system.
With the gpudev library is also possible to add additional non-physical devices
through an ``uint64_t`` generic handler (e.g. CUDA Driver context)
that will be registered internally by the driver as an additional device (child)
connected to a physical device (parent).
Each device (parent or child) is represented through a ID
required to indicate which device a given operation should be executed on.

Memory Allocation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

gpudev can allocate on an input given GPU device a memory area
returning the pointer to that memory.
Later, it's also possible to free that memory with gpudev.
GPU memory allocated outside of the gpudev library
(e.g. with GPU-specific library) cannot be freed by the gpudev library.

Memory Registration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

gpudev can register a CPU memory area to make it visible from a GPU device.
Later, it's also possible to unregister that memory with gpudev.
CPU memory registered outside of the gpudev library
(e.g. with GPU specific library) cannot be unregistered by the gpudev library.

CPU mapping
~~~~~~~~~~~

gpudev can map into the CPU address space a GPU memory address allocated with gpudev.
gpudev returns a pointer the CPU can use to access (ready or write) GPU memory.
Later, it's also possible to unmap that memory with gpudev.
GPU memory CPU mapped outside of the gpudev library (e.g. with GPU specific library)
cannot be unmapped by the gpudev library.

Memory Barrier
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some GPU drivers may need, under certain conditions,
to enforce the coherency of external devices writes (e.g. NIC receiving packets)
into the GPU memory.
gpudev abstracts and exposes this capability.

Communication Flag
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Considering an application with some GPU task
that's waiting to receive a signal from the CPU
to move forward with the execution.
The communication flag allocates a CPU memory GPU-visible ``uint32_t`` flag
that can be used by the CPU to communicate with a GPU task.

Communication list
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, DPDK pulls free mbufs from a mempool to receive packets.
Best practice, especially in a multithreaded application,
is to no make any assumption on which mbufs will be used
to receive the next bursts of packets.
Considering an application with a GPU memory mempool
attached to a receive queue having some task waiting on the GPU
to receive a new burst of packets to be processed,
there is the need to communicate from the CPU
the list of mbuf payload addresses where received packet have been stored.
The ``rte_gpu_comm_*()`` functions are responsible to create a list of packets
that can be populated with receive mbuf payload addresses
and communicated to the task running on the GPU.

about how to use functions in this library in case of a CUDA application.
