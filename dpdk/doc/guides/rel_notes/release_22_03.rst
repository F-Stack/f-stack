DPDK Release 22.03
==================

New Features
------------

* **Added ability to reuse hugepages in Linux.**

  It is now possible to reuse files in hugetlbfs to speed up hugepage mapping,
  which may be useful for fast restart and large allocations.
  The new mode is activated with ``--huge-unlink=never``
  and has security implications, refer to the user and programmer guides.

* **Added functions to calculate UDP/TCP checksum in mbuf.**

  Added the following functions to calculate UDP/TCP checksum of packets
  which can be over multi-segments:

  - ``rte_ipv4_udptcp_cksum_mbuf()``
  - ``rte_ipv4_udptcp_cksum_mbuf_verify()``
  - ``rte_ipv6_udptcp_cksum_mbuf()``
  - ``rte_ipv6_udptcp_cksum_mbuf_verify()``

* **Added functions to configure the flow engine.**

  Added the ``rte_flow_configure`` API to configure the flow management
  engine, allowing preallocation of some resources for better performance.
  Added ``rte_flow_info_get`` API to retrieve available resources.

  Added ``rte_flow_template_table_create`` API to group flow rules
  with the same flow attributes and common matching patterns and actions
  defined by ``rte_flow_pattern_template_create`` and
  ``rte_flow_actions_template_create`` respectively.
  The corresponding functions to destroy these entities are:
  ``rte_flow_template_table_destroy``, ``rte_flow_pattern_template_destroy``
  and ``rte_flow_actions_template_destroy``.

* **Added functions for asynchronous flow rules creation and destruction.**

  Added the ``rte_flow_async_create`` and ``rte_flow_async_destroy`` APIs
  to enqueue flow creation/destruction operations asynchronously as well as
  ``rte_flow_pull`` to poll and retrieve results of these operations and
  ``rte_flow_push`` to push all the in-flight	operations to the NIC.

  Added asynchronous APIs for indirect actions management:

  - ``rte_flow_async_action_handle_create``

  Kunpeng930 DMA devices are now enabled for HiSilicon DMA PMD.

* **Added CNXK GPIO PMD.**

  Added a new rawdevice PMD which allows managing userspace GPIOs and installing
  custom GPIO interrupt handlers which bypass the kernel. This is especially useful
  for applications that as well as providing standard dataplane functionality
  also want to have fast and low latency access to GPIO pin state.

  See the :doc:`../rawdevs/cnxk_gpio` rawdev guide for more details on this
  driver.

  modes of event crypto adapter.


Removed Items
-------------

* **Removed experimental performance thread example application.**


API Changes
-----------

* net: added experimental functions ``rte_ipv4_udptcp_cksum_mbuf()``,
  ``rte_ipv4_udptcp_cksum_mbuf_verify()``, ``rte_ipv6_udptcp_cksum_mbuf()``,
  ``rte_ipv6_udptcp_cksum_mbuf_verify()``

* ethdev: Old public macros and enumeration constants without ``RTE_ETH_`` prefix,
  which are kept for backward compatibility, are marked as deprecated.

* cryptodev: The asymmetric session handling was modified to use a single
  mempool object. An API ``rte_cryptodev_asym_session_pool_create`` was added
  to create a mempool with element size big enough to hold the generic asymmetric
  session header, max size for a device private session data, and user data size.
  The session structure was moved to ``cryptodev_pmd.h``,
  hiding it from applications.
  The API ``rte_cryptodev_asym_session_init`` was removed as the initialization
  is now moved to ``rte_cryptodev_asym_session_create``, which was updated to
  return an integer value to indicate initialisation errors.


ABI Changes
-----------

* No ABI change that would break compatibility with 21.11.


Known Issues
------------

* **Possible reduced power saving with PMD Power Management.**

  Users may see reduced power savings when using PMD Power Management.
  This issue occurs when compiling DPDK applications with GCC-9
  on platforms with TSX enabled.
  The function ``rte_power_monitor_multi()`` may return
  without successfully starting the RTM transaction (``_xbegin()`` fails).

  There are three workarounds for this issue.
  Either build DPDK with GCC-11 or newer, build with shared libraries,
  or build DPDK with fewer drivers.
