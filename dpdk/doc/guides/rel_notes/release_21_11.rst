Removed Items
-------------

* eal: Removed the deprecated function ``rte_get_master_lcore()``
  and the iterator macro ``RTE_LCORE_FOREACH_SLAVE``.

* eal: The old API arguments that were deprecated for
  blacklist/whitelist are removed. Users must use the new
  block/allow list arguments.

* mbuf: Removed offload flag ``PKT_RX_EIP_CKSUM_BAD``.
  The ``PKT_RX_OUTER_IP_CKSUM_BAD`` flag should be used as a replacement.

* ethdev: Removed the port mirroring API. A more fine-grain flow API
  action ``RTE_FLOW_ACTION_TYPE_SAMPLE`` should be used instead.
  The structures ``rte_eth_mirror_conf`` and ``rte_eth_vlan_mirror`` and
  the functions ``rte_eth_mirror_rule_set`` and
  ``rte_eth_mirror_rule_reset`` along with the associated macros
  ``ETH_MIRROR_*`` are removed.

* ethdev: Removed the ``rte_eth_rx_descriptor_done()`` API function and its
  driver callback. It is replaced by the more complete function
  ``rte_eth_rx_descriptor_status()``.

* ethdev: Removed deprecated ``shared`` attribute of the
  ``struct rte_flow_action_count``. Shared counters should be managed
  using indirect actions API (``rte_flow_action_handle_create`` etc).

* i40e: Removed i40evf driver.
  iavf already became the default VF driver for i40e devices,
  so there is no need to maintain i40evf.


API Changes
-----------

* eal: The lcore state ``FINISHED`` is removed from
  the ``enum rte_lcore_state_t``.
  The lcore state ``WAIT`` is enough to represent the same state.

* eal: Made ``rte_intr_handle`` structure definition hidden.

* kvargs: The experimental function ``rte_kvargs_strcmp()`` has been
  removed. Its usages have been replaced by a new function
  ``rte_kvargs_get_with_value()``.

* cmdline: ``cmdline_stdin_exit()`` now frees the ``cmdline`` structure.
  Calls to ``cmdline_free()`` after it need to be deleted from applications.

* cmdline: Made ``cmdline`` structure definition hidden on Linux and FreeBSD.

* cmdline: Made ``rdline`` structure definition hidden. Functions are added
  to dynamically allocate and free it, and to access user data in callbacks.

* mempool: Added ``RTE_MEMPOOL_F_NON_IO`` flag to give a hint to DPDK components
  that objects from this pool will not be used for device IO (e.g. DMA).

* mempool: The mempool flags ``MEMPOOL_F_*`` will be deprecated in the future.
  Newly added flags with ``RTE_MEMPOOL_F_`` prefix should be used instead.

* mempool: Helper macro ``MEMPOOL_HEADER_SIZE()`` is deprecated.
  The replacement macro ``RTE_MEMPOOL_HEADER_SIZE()`` is internal only.

* mempool: Macro to register mempool driver ``MEMPOOL_REGISTER_OPS()`` is
  deprecated.  Use replacement ``RTE_MEMPOOL_REGISTER_OPS()``.

* mempool: The mempool API macros ``MEMPOOL_PG_*`` are deprecated and
  will be removed in DPDK 22.11.

* mbuf: The mbuf offload flags ``PKT_*`` are renamed as ``RTE_MBUF_F_*``. A
  compatibility layer will be kept until DPDK 22.11.
* net: Renamed ``s_addr`` and ``d_addr`` fields of ``rte_ether_hdr`` structure
  to ``src_addr`` and ``dst_addr``, respectively.

* net: Added ``version`` and ``ihl`` bit-fields to ``struct rte_ipv4_hdr``.
  Existing ``version_ihl`` field is kept for backward compatibility.

* ethdev: Added items and actions ``PORT_REPRESENTOR``, ``REPRESENTED_PORT`` to
  flow API.

* ethdev: Deprecated items and actions ``PF``, ``VF``, ``PHY_PORT``, ``PORT_ID``.
  Suggested items and actions ``PORT_REPRESENTOR``, ``REPRESENTED_PORT`` instead.

* ethdev: Deprecated the use of attributes ``ingress`` / ``egress`` combined
  with ``transfer``. See items ``PORT_REPRESENTOR``, ``REPRESENTED_PORT``.

* ethdev: ``rte_flow_action_modify_data`` structure updated, immediate data
  array is extended, data pointer field is explicitly added to union, the
  action behavior is defined in a more strict fashion and documentation updated.
  The immediate value behavior has been changed, the entire immediate field
  should be provided, and offset for immediate source bitfield is assigned
  from the destination one.

* vhost: ``rte_vdpa_register_device``, ``rte_vdpa_unregister_device``,
  ``rte_vhost_host_notifier_ctrl`` and ``rte_vdpa_relay_vring_used`` vDPA
  driver interface are marked as internal.

* cryptodev: The API ``rte_cryptodev_pmd_is_valid_dev()`` is modified to
  ``rte_cryptodev_is_valid_dev()`` as it can be used by the application as
  well as the PMD to check whether the device is valid or not.

* cryptodev: The ``rte_cryptodev_pmd.*`` files are renamed to ``cryptodev_pmd.*``
  since they are for drivers only and should be private to DPDK, and not
  installed for app use.

* cryptodev: A ``reserved`` byte from structure ``rte_crypto_op`` was
  renamed to ``aux_flags`` to indicate warnings and other information from
  the crypto/security operation. This field will be used to communicate
  events such as soft expiry with IPsec in lookaside mode.

* cryptodev: The field ``dataunit_len`` of the ``struct rte_crypto_cipher_xform``
  moved to the end of the structure and extended to ``uint32_t``.

* cryptodev: The structure ``rte_crypto_vec`` was updated to add ``tot_len``
  field to support total buffer length to facilitate protocol offload case.

* cryptodev: The structure ``rte_crypto_sym_vec`` was updated to add
  ``dest_sgl`` to support out of place processing.

* bbdev: Added device info related to data byte endianness processing.

* eventdev: Moved memory used by timer adapters to hugepage. This will prevent
  TLB misses if any and aligns to memory structure of other subsystems.

* fib: Added the ``rib_ext_sz`` field to ``rte_fib_conf`` and ``rte_fib6_conf``
  so that user can specify the size of the RIB extension inside the FIB.

* ip_frag: All macros updated to have ``RTE_IP_FRAG_`` prefix.
  Obsolete macros are kept for compatibility.
  DPDK components updated to use new names.
  Experimental function ``rte_frag_table_del_expired_entries()`` was renamed
  to ``rte_ip_frag_table_del_expired_entries()``
  to comply with other public API naming convention.


ABI Changes
-----------

* ethdev: All enums and macros updated to have ``RTE_ETH`` prefix and structures
  updated to have ``rte_eth`` prefix. DPDK components updated to use new names.

* ethdev: The input parameters for ``eth_rx_queue_count_t`` were changed.
  Instead of a pointer to ``rte_eth_dev`` and queue index, it now accepts a pointer
  to internal queue data as an input parameter. While this change is transparent
  to the user, it still counts as an ABI change, as ``eth_rx_queue_count_t``
  is used by the public inline function ``rte_eth_rx_queue_count``.

* ethdev: Made ``rte_eth_dev``, ``rte_eth_dev_data``, ``rte_eth_rxtx_callback``
  private data structures. ``rte_eth_devices[]`` can't be accessed directly
  by user any more. While it is an ABI breakage, this change is intended
  to be transparent for both users (no changes in user app is required) and
  PMD developers (no changes in PMD is required).

* vhost: rename ``struct vhost_device_ops`` to ``struct rte_vhost_device_ops``.

* cryptodev: Made ``rte_cryptodev``, ``rte_cryptodev_data`` private
  structures internal to DPDK. ``rte_cryptodevs`` can't be accessed directly
  by user any more. While it is an ABI breakage, this change is intended
  to be transparent for both users (no changes in user app is required) and
  PMD developers (no changes in PMD is required).

* security: ``rte_security_set_pkt_metadata`` and ``rte_security_get_userdata``
  routines used by inline outbound and inline inbound security processing were
  made inline and enhanced to do simple 64-bit set/get for PMDs that do not
  have much processing in PMD specific callbacks but just 64-bit set/get.
  This avoids a per packet function pointer jump overhead for such PMDs.

* security: A new option ``iv_gen_disable`` was added in structure
  ``rte_security_ipsec_sa_options`` to disable IV generation inside PMD,
  so that application can provide its own IV and test known test vectors.

* security: A new option ``tunnel_hdr_verify`` was added in structure
  ``rte_security_ipsec_sa_options`` to indicate whether outer header
  verification need to be done as part of inbound IPsec processing.

* security: A new option ``udp_ports_verify`` was added in structure
  ``rte_security_ipsec_sa_options`` to indicate whether UDP ports
  verification need to be done as part of inbound IPsec processing.

* security: A new structure ``rte_security_ipsec_lifetime`` was added to
  replace ``esn_soft_limit`` in IPsec configuration structure
  ``rte_security_ipsec_xform`` to allow applications to configure SA soft
  and hard expiry limits. Limits can be either in number of packets or bytes.

* security: The new options ``ip_csum_enable`` and ``l4_csum_enable`` were added
  in structure ``rte_security_ipsec_sa_options`` to indicate whether inner
  packet IPv4 header checksum and L4 checksum need to be offloaded to
  security device.

* security: A new structure ``esn`` was added in structure
  ``rte_security_ipsec_xform`` to set an initial ESN value. This permits
  applications to start from an arbitrary ESN value for debug and SA lifetime
  enforcement purposes.

* security: A new structure ``udp`` was added in structure
  ``rte_security_ipsec_xform`` to allow setting the source and destination ports
  for UDP encapsulated IPsec traffic.

* bbdev: Added capability related to more comprehensive CRC options,
  shifting values of the ``enum rte_bbdev_op_ldpcdec_flag_bitmasks``.

* eventdev: New variables ``rx_event_buf_count`` and ``rx_event_buf_size``
  were added in structure ``rte_event_eth_rx_adapter_stats`` to get additional
  status.

* eventdev: A new structure ``rte_event_fp_ops`` has been added which is now used
  by the fastpath inline functions. The structures ``rte_eventdev``,
  ``rte_eventdev_data`` have been made internal. ``rte_eventdevs[]`` can't be
  accessed directly by user any more. This change is transparent to both
  applications and PMDs.

* eventdev: Re-arranged fields in ``rte_event_timer`` to remove holes.

* ip_frag: Increased default value for config parameter
  ``RTE_LIBRTE_IP_FRAG_MAX_FRAG`` from ``4`` to ``8``.
  This parameter controls maximum number of fragments per packet
  in IP reassembly table. Increasing this value from ``4`` to ``8``
  will allow covering the common case with jumbo packet size of ``9000B``
  and fragments with default frame size ``(1500B)``.
