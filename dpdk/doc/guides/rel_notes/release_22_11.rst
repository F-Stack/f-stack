DPDK Release 22.11
==================

New Features
------------

* **Added initial LoongArch architecture support.**

  Added EAL implementation for LoongArch architecture.
  The initial port was tested on Loongson 3A5000,
  Loongson 3C5000 and Loongson 3C5000L.
  In theory this implementation should work with any target based on
  ``LoongArch`` ISA.

* **Added support for multiple mbuf pools per ethdev Rx queue.**

  Added a capability which allows an application to provide many mempools
  of different size, and PMDs and/or NICs to choose a memory pool
  based on the packet's length and/or Rx buffer availability.

* **Added support for congestion management in ethdev.**

  Added new API functions ``rte_eth_cman_config_init()``,
  ``rte_eth_cman_config_get()``, ``rte_eth_cman_config_set()``
  and ``rte_eth_cman_info_get()`` to support congestion management.

* **Added protocol header based buffer split.**

  * Added ``rte_eth_buffer_split_get_supported_hdr_ptypes()`` to get supported
    header protocols to split at.
  * Added support for protocol-based buffer split using new ``proto_hdr``
    field in structure ``rte_eth_rxseg_split``.

* **Added proactive error handling mode for ethdev.**

  Added proactive error handling mode for ethdev,
  and introduced three new events: ``RTE_ETH_EVENT_ERR_RECOVERING``
  to report that the port is recovering from an error,
  ``RTE_ETH_EVENT_RECOVER_SUCCESS`` and ``RTE_ETH_EVENT_RECOVER_FAILED``.

* **Added ethdev Rx/Tx descriptor dump API.**

  Added the ethdev Rx/Tx descriptor dump API which provides functions
  for querying descriptor from device.
  The descriptor information differs in different NICs.
  The information demonstrates I/O process which is important for debug.
  The dump format is vendor-specific.

* **Added ethdev hairpin memory configuration options.**

  Added new configuration flags for hairpin queues in ``rte_eth_hairpin_conf``:

  * ``use_locked_device_memory``

    for a given flow rule will strictly happen on the same flow queue.

* **Added configuration for asynchronous flow connection tracking.**

  Added connection tracking action number hint to ``rte_flow_configure``
  and ``rte_flow_info_get``.
  The PMD can prepare the connection tracking resources according to the hint.

* **Added support for queue-based async query in flow API.**

  Added new function ``rte_flow_async_action_handle_query()``
  to query the action asynchronously.

Removed Items
-------------

* mem: Removed not implemented and deprecated ``rte_malloc_set_limit``.

* ethdev: removed ``RTE_FLOW_ITEM_TYPE_PF``;
  use ``RTE_FLOW_ITEM_TYPE_REPRESENTED_PORT`` instead.

* ethdev: removed ``RTE_FLOW_ITEM_TYPE_VF``;
  use ``RTE_FLOW_ITEM_TYPE_REPRESENTED_PORT`` instead.

* ethdev: removed ``RTE_FLOW_ITEM_TYPE_PHY_PORT``;
  use ``RTE_FLOW_ITEM_TYPE_REPRESENTED_PORT`` instead.

* ethdev: removed ``RTE_FLOW_ACTION_TYPE_PHY_PORT``;
  use ``RTE_FLOW_ACTION_TYPE_REPRESENTED_PORT`` instead.

* ethdev: removed ``OF_SET_MPLS_TTL``, ``OF_DEC_MPLS_TTL``,
  ``OF_SET_NW_TTL``, ``OF_COPY_TTL_OUT`` and ``OF_COPY_TTL_IN``
  which are not actually supported by any PMD.
  ``MODIFY_FIELD`` action should be used to do packet edits via flow API.

* vhost: Removed deprecated ``rte_vhost_gpa_to_vva`` and
  ``rte_vhost_get_queue_num`` helpers.


API Changes
-----------

* eal: ``RTE_FUNC_PTR_OR_*`` macros have been marked deprecated and will be removed
  in the future. Applications can use ``devtools/cocci/func_or_ret.cocci``
  to update their code.

* eal: Updated ``rte_eal_remote_launch`` so it returns ``-EPIPE`` in case of
  a read or write error on the pipe, instead of calling ``rte_panic``.

* eal: Updated return types for ``rte_{bsf,fls}`` inline functions
  to be consistently ``uint32_t``.

* mempool: Deprecated helper macro ``MEMPOOL_HEADER_SIZE()`` has been removed.
  The replacement macro ``RTE_MEMPOOL_HEADER_SIZE()`` is internal only.

* mempool: Deprecated macro to register mempool driver
  ``MEMPOOL_REGISTER_OPS()`` has been removed. Use replacement macro
  ``RTE_MEMPOOL_REGISTER_OPS()`` instead.

* mempool: Deprecated macros ``MEMPOOL_PG_NUM_DEFAULT`` and
  ``MEMPOOL_PG_SHIFT_MAX`` have been removed. These macros are not used and
  not required any more.

* mbuf: Removed deprecated ``PKT_*`` flags.
  Use corresponding flags with ``RTE_MBUF_F_`` prefix instead.
  Applications can use ``devtools/cocci/prefix_mbuf_offload_flags.cocci``
  to replace all occurrences of old mbuf flags in C code.

* bus: Changed the device numa node to -1 when NUMA information is unavailable.
  The ``dev->device.numa_node`` field is set by each bus driver for
  every device it manages to indicate on which NUMA node this device lies.
  When this information is unknown, the assigned value was not consistent
  across the bus drivers. This similarly impacts ``rte_eth_dev_socket_id()``.

* bus: Registering a bus has been marked as an internal API.
  External users may still register their bus using the ``bus_driver.h``
  driver header (see ``enable_driver_sdk`` meson option).
  The ``rte_bus`` object is now opaque and must be manipulated through added
  accessors.

* drivers: Registering a driver on the ``auxiliary``, ``ifpga``, ``pci``,
  ``vdev``, ``vmbus`` buses has been marked as an internal API.
  External users may still register their driver using the associated driver
  headers (see ``enable_driver_sdk`` meson option).
  The ``rte_driver`` and ``rte_device`` objects are now opaque and must be
  manipulated through added accessors.

* ethdev: Removed deprecated macros. Applications can use ``devtools/cocci/namespace_ethdev.cocci``
  to update their code.

  * Removed deprecated ``ETH_LINK_SPEED_*``, ``ETH_SPEED_NUM_*`` and ``ETH_LINK_*``
    (duplex-related) defines.  Use corresponding defines with ``RTE_`` prefix
    instead.

  * Removed deprecated ``ETH_MQ_RX_*`` and ``ETH_MQ_TX_*`` defines.
    Use corresponding defines with ``RTE_`` prefix instead.

  * Removed deprecated ``ETH_RSS_*`` defines for hash function and
    RETA size specification. Use corresponding defines with ``RTE_`` prefix
    instead.

  * Removed deprecated ``DEV_RX_OFFLOAD_*`` and ``DEV_TX_OFFLOAD_``
    defines. Use corresponding defines with ``RTE_ETH_RX_OFFLOAD_`` and
    ``RTE_ETH_TX_OFFLOAD_`` prefix instead.

  * Removed deprecated ``ETH_DCB_*``, ``ETH_VMDQ_``, ``ETH_*_TCS``,
    ``ETH_*_POOLS`` and ``ETH_MAX_VMDQ_POOL`` defines. Use corresponding
    defines with ``RTE_`` prefix instead.

  * Removed deprecated ``RTE_TUNNEL_*`` defines. Use corresponding
    defines with ``RTE_ETH_TUNNEL_`` prefix instead.

  * Removed deprecated ``RTE_FC_*`` defines. Use corresponding
    defines with ``RTE_ETH_FC_`` prefix instead.

  * Removed deprecated ``ETH_VLAN_*`` and ``ETH_QINQ_`` defines.
    Use corresponding defines with ``RTE_`` prefix instead.

  * Removed deprecated ``ETH_NUM_RECEIVE_MAC_ADDR`` define.
    Use corresponding define with ``RTE_`` prefix instead.

  * Removed deprecated ``PKT_{R,T}X_DYNF_METADATA`` defines.
    Use corresponding defines ``RTE_MBUF_DYNFLAG_{R,T}X_METADATA`` instead.

* ethdev: Removed deprecated Flow Director configuration from device
  configuration (``dev_conf.fdir_conf``). Moved corresponding structures
  to internal API since some drivers still use it internally.

* ethdev: Removed the Rx offload flag ``RTE_ETH_RX_OFFLOAD_HEADER_SPLIT``
  and field ``split_hdr_size`` from the structure ``rte_eth_rxmode``
  used to configure header split.
  Instead, user can still use ``RTE_ETH_RX_OFFLOAD_BUFFER_SPLIT``
  for per-queue packet split offload,
  which is configured by ``rte_eth_rxseg_split``.

* ethdev: The ``reserved`` field in the ``rte_eth_rxseg_split`` structure is
  replaced with ``proto_hdr`` to support protocol header based buffer split.
  User can choose length or protocol header to configure buffer split
  according to NIC's capability.

* ethdev: Changed the type of the parameter ``rate`` of the function
  ``rte_eth_set_queue_rate_limit()`` from ``uint16_t`` to ``uint32_t``
  to support more than 64 Gbps.
  Changed the type of the parameter ``tx_rate`` of the functions
  ``rte_pmd_bnxt_set_vf_rate_limit()`` and
  ``rte_pmd_ixgbe_set_vf_rate_limit()`` in the same way for consistency.

* ethdev: Promoted ``rte_eth_rx_metadata_negotiate()``
  from experimental to stable.

* ethdev: Promoted the following flow primitives
  from experimental to stable:

  - ``RTE_FLOW_ACTION_TYPE_PORT_REPRESENTOR``
  - ``RTE_FLOW_ACTION_TYPE_REPRESENTED_PORT``
  - ``RTE_FLOW_ITEM_TYPE_PORT_REPRESENTOR``
  - ``RTE_FLOW_ITEM_TYPE_REPRESENTED_PORT``

* ethdev: Promoted ``rte_flow_pick_transfer_proxy()``
  from experimental to stable.

* ethdev: Banned the use of attributes ``ingress``/``egress`` in "transfer"
  flows, as the final step of the deprecation process that had been started
  in DPDK 21.11. See items ``PORT_REPRESENTOR``, ``REPRESENTED_PORT``.

* vhost: Promoted ``rte_vhost_vring_stats_get()``,
  ``rte_vhost_vring_stats_get_names()`` and ``rte_vhost_vring_stats_reset()``
  from experimental to stable.

* cryptodev: The structure ``rte_cryptodev_sym_session`` was made internal.
  The API ``rte_cryptodev_sym_session_init`` and ``rte_cryptodev_sym_session_clear``
  were removed and user would only need to call ``rte_cryptodev_sym_session_create``
  and ``rte_cryptodev_sym_session_free`` to create/destroy sessions.
  The API ``rte_cryptodev_sym_session_create`` was updated to take a single mempool
  with element size big enough to hold session data and session private data.
  All sample applications were updated to attach an opaque pointer for the session
  to the ``rte_crypto_op`` while enqueuing.

* security: The structure ``rte_security_session`` was made internal
  and corresponding functions were updated to take/return an opaque session pointer.
  The API ``rte_security_session_create`` was updated to take only one mempool
  which has enough space to hold session and driver private data.

* security: MACsec support has been added which resulted in updates
  to structures ``rte_security_macsec_xform``, ``rte_security_macsec_stats``
  and security capability structure ``rte_security_capability``
  to accommodate MACsec capabilities.

* security: The experimental API ``rte_security_get_userdata`` was being unused
  by most of the drivers and it was retrieving userdata from mbuf dynamic field.
  The API is now removed and the application can directly get the userdata from
  mbuf dynamic field.

* eventdev: The function ``rte_event_crypto_adapter_queue_pair_add`` was updated
  to accept configuration of type ``rte_event_crypto_adapter_queue_conf``
  instead of ``rte_event``,
  similar to ``rte_event_eth_rx_adapter_queue_add`` signature.
  Event will be one of the configuration fields,
  together with additional vector parameters.

* eventdev: The function pointer definition ``eventdev_stop_flush_t``
  is renamed to ``rte_eventdev_stop_flush_t``
  to avoid conflicts with application symbols.

* eventdev: The data type of the ID parameter in the functions
  ``rte_event_dev_xstats_names_get``, ``rte_event_dev_xstats_get``,
  ``rte_event_dev_xstats_by_name_get`` and ``rte_event_dev_xstats_reset``
  is changed to ``uint64_t`` from ``unsigned int`` and ``uint32_t``.

* metrics: Updated ``rte_metrics_init`` so it returns an error code instead
  of calling ``rte_exit``.

* telemetry: The allowed characters in names for dictionary values
  are now limited to alphanumeric characters and a small subset of additional
  printable characters.
  This will ensure that all dictionary parameter names can be output
  without escaping in JSON - or in any future output format used.
  Names for the telemetry commands are now similarly limited.
  The parameters for telemetry commands are unaffected by this change.

* raw/ifgpa: The function ``rte_pmd_ifpga_get_pci_bus`` has been removed.


ABI Changes
-----------

* eal: Updated EAL thread names from ``lcore-worker-<lcore_id>`` to
  ``rte-worker-<lcore_id>`` so that DPDK can accommodate lcores higher than 99.

* mbuf: Replaced ``buf_iova`` field with ``next`` field and added a new field
  ``dynfield2`` at its place in second cacheline if ``RTE_IOVA_AS_PA`` is 0.

* ethdev: enum ``RTE_FLOW_ITEM`` was affected by deprecation procedure.

* ethdev: enum ``RTE_FLOW_ACTION`` was affected by deprecation procedure.

* bbdev: enum ``rte_bbdev_op_type`` was affected to remove ``RTE_BBDEV_OP_TYPE_COUNT``
  and to allow for futureproof enum insertion a padded ``RTE_BBDEV_OP_TYPE_SIZE_MAX``
  macro is added.

* bbdev: Structure ``rte_bbdev_driver_info`` was updated to add new parameters
  for queue topology, device status using ``rte_bbdev_device_status``.

* bbdev: Structure ``rte_bbdev_queue_data`` was updated to add new parameter
  for enqueue status using ``rte_bbdev_enqueue_status``.

* eventdev: Added ``evtim_drop_count`` field
  to ``rte_event_timer_adapter_stats`` structure.

* eventdev: Added ``weight`` and ``affinity`` fields
  to ``rte_event_queue_conf`` structure.

* eventdev: The field ``*u64s`` in the structure ``rte_event_vector`` is replaced
  with ``u64s`` as the field is supposed to hold an array of ``uint64_t`` values.

* eventdev: The structure ``rte_event_vector`` was updated to include a new bit
  field ``elem_offset:12``. The bits are taken from the bitfield ``rsvd:15``.
