     should be enough to allow someone scanning the release notes to understand
     the new feature.

     If the feature adds a lot of sub-features you can use a bullet list like this.

     * Added feature foo to do something.
     * Enhanced feature bar to do something else.

     =========================================================

* **Added support for representing buses in EAL**

  The ``rte_bus`` structure was introduced into the EAL. This allows for
  devices to be represented by buses they are connected to. A new bus can be
  added to DPDK by extending the ``rte_bus`` structure and implementing the
  scan and probe functions. Once a new bus is registered using the provided
  APIs, new devices can be detected and initialized using bus scan and probe
  callbacks.

  With this change, devices other than PCI or VDEV type can be represented
  in the DPDK framework.

* **Added generic EAL API for I/O device memory read/write operations.**

  This API introduces 8 bit, 16 bit, 32 bit and 64 bit I/O device
  memory read/write operations along with "relaxed" versions.

  Weakly-ordered architectures like ARM need an additional I/O barrier for
  device memory read/write access over PCI bus. By introducing the EAL
  abstraction for I/O device memory read/write access, the drivers can access
  I/O device memory in an architecture-agnostic manner. The relaxed version
  does not have an additional I/O memory barrier, which is useful in accessing
  the device registers of integrated controllers which is implicitly strongly
  ordered with respect to memory access.

* **Added generic flow API (rte_flow).**

  This API provides a generic means to configure hardware to match specific
  ingress or egress traffic, alter its behavior and query related counters
  according to any number of user-defined rules.

  In order to expose a single interface with an unambiguous behavior that is
  common to all poll-mode drivers (PMDs) the ``rte_flow`` API is slightly
  higher-level than the legacy filtering framework, which it encompasses and
  supersedes (including all functions and filter types) .

  See the :ref:`Generic flow API <Generic_flow_API>` documentation for more
  information.

* **Added firmware version get API.**

  Added a new function ``rte_eth_dev_fw_version_get()`` to fetch the firmware
  version for a given device.

* **Added APIs for MACsec offload support to the ixgbe PMD.**

  Six new APIs have been added to the ixgbe PMD for MACsec offload support.
  The declarations for the APIs can be found in ``rte_pmd_ixgbe.h``.

* **Added I219 NICs support.**

  Added support for I219 Intel 1GbE NICs.

* **Added VF Daemon (VFD) for i40e. - EXPERIMENTAL**

  This is an EXPERIMENTAL feature to enhance the capability of the DPDK PF as
  many VF management features are not currently supported by the kernel PF
  driver. Some new private APIs are implemented directly in the PMD without an
  abstraction layer. They can be used directly by some users who have the
  need.

  The new APIs to control VFs directly from PF include:

  * Set VF MAC anti-spoofing.
  * Set VF VLAN anti-spoofing.
  * Set TX loopback.
  * Set VF unicast promiscuous mode.
  * Set VF multicast promiscuous mode.
  * Set VF MTU.
  * Get/reset VF stats.
  * Set VF MAC address.
  * Set VF VLAN stripping.
  * Vf VLAN insertion.
  * Set VF broadcast mode.
  * Set VF VLAN tag.
  * Set VF VLAN filter.

  VFD also includes VF to PF mailbox message management from an application.
  When the PF receives mailbox messages from the VF the PF should call the
  callback provided by the application to know if they're permitted to be
  processed.

  As an EXPERIMENTAL feature, please be aware it can be changed or even
  removed without prior notice.

* **Updated the i40e base driver.**

  Updated the i40e base driver, including the following changes:

  * Replace existing legacy ``memcpy()`` calls with ``i40e_memcpy()`` calls.
  * Use ``BIT()`` macro instead of bit fields.
  * Add clear all WoL filters implementation.
  * Add broadcast promiscuous control per VLAN.
  * Remove unused ``X722_SUPPORT`` and ``I40E_NDIS_SUPPORT`` macros.

* **Updated the enic driver.**

  * Set new Rx checksum flags in mbufs to indicate unknown, good or bad checksums.
  * Fix set/remove of MAC addresses. Allow up to 64 addresses per device.
  * Enable TSO on outer headers.

* **Added Solarflare libefx-based network PMD.**

  Added a new network PMD which supports Solarflare SFN7xxx and SFN8xxx family
  of 10/40 Gbps adapters.

* **Updated the mlx4 driver.**

  * Addressed a few bugs.

* **Added support for Mellanox ConnectX-5 adapters (mlx5).**

  Added support for Mellanox ConnectX-5 family of 10/25/40/50/100 Gbps
  adapters to the existing mlx5 PMD.

* **Updated the mlx5 driver.**

  * Improve Tx performance by using vector logic.
  * Improve RSS balancing when number of queues is not a power of two.
  * Generic flow API support for Ethernet, IPv4, IPv4, UDP, TCP, VLAN and
    VXLAN pattern items with DROP and QUEUE actions.
  * Support for extended statistics.
  * Addressed several data path bugs.
  * As of MLNX_OFED 4.0-1.0.1.0, the Toeplitz RSS hash function is not
    symmetric anymore for consistency with other PMDs.

* **virtio-user with vhost-kernel as another exceptional path.**

  Previously, we upstreamed a virtual device, virtio-user with vhost-user as
  the backend as a way of enabling IPC (Inter-Process Communication) and user
  space container networking.

  Virtio-user with vhost-kernel as the backend is a solution for the exception
  path, such as KNI, which exchanges packets with the kernel networking stack.
  This solution is very promising in:

  * Maintenance: vhost and vhost-net (kernel) is an upstreamed and extensively
    used kernel module.
  * Features: vhost-net is designed to be a networking solution, which has
    lots of networking related features, like multi-queue, TSO, multi-seg
    mbuf, etc.
  * Performance: similar to KNI, this solution would use one or more
    kthreads to send/receive packets from user space DPDK applications,
    which has little impact on user space polling thread (except that
    it might enter into kernel space to wake up those kthreads if
    necessary).

* **Added virtio Rx interrupt support.**

  Added a feature to enable Rx interrupt mode for virtio pci net devices as
  bound to VFIO (noiommu mode) and driven by virtio PMD.

  With this feature, the virtio PMD can switch between polling mode and
  interrupt mode, to achieve best performance, and at the same time save
  power. It can work on both legacy and modern virtio devices. In this mode,
  each ``rxq`` is mapped with an excluded MSIx interrupt.

  See the :ref:`Virtio Interrupt Mode <virtio_interrupt_mode>` documentation
  for more information.

* **Added ARMv8 crypto PMD.**

  A new crypto PMD has been added, which provides combined mode cryptographic
  operations optimized for ARMv8 processors. The driver can be used to enhance
  performance in processing chained operations such as cipher + HMAC.

* **Updated the QAT PMD.**

  The QAT PMD has been updated with additional support for:

  * DES algorithm.
  * Scatter-gather list (SGL) support.

* **Updated the AESNI MB PMD.**

  * The Intel(R) Multi Buffer Crypto for IPsec library used in
    AESNI MB PMD has been moved to a new repository, in GitHub.
  * Support has been added for single operations (cipher only and
    authentication only).

* **Updated the AES-NI GCM PMD.**

  The AES-NI GCM PMD was migrated from the Multi Buffer library to the ISA-L
  library. The migration entailed adding additional support for:

  * GMAC algorithm.
  * 256-bit cipher key.
  * Session-less mode.
  * Out-of place processing
  * Scatter-gather support for chained mbufs (only out-of place and destination
    mbuf must be contiguous)

* **Added crypto performance test application.**

  Added a new performance test application for measuring performance
  parameters of PMDs available in the crypto tree.

* **Added Elastic Flow Distributor library (rte_efd).**

  Added a new library which uses perfect hashing to determine a target/value
  for a given incoming flow key.

  The library does not store the key itself for lookup operations, and
  therefore, lookup performance is not dependent on the key size. Also, the
  target/value can be any arbitrary value (8 bits by default). Finally, the
  storage requirement is much smaller than a hash-based flow table and
  therefore, it can better fit in CPU cache and scale to millions of flow
  keys.

  See the :ref:`Elastic Flow Distributor Library <Efd_Library>` documentation in
  the Programmers Guide document, for more information.
