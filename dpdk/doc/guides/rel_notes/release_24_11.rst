DPDK Release 24.11
==================

New Features
------------

* **Added new bit manipulation API.**

  Extended support for bit-level operations on single 32 and 64-bit words in
  ``<rte_bitops.h>`` with semantically well-defined functions.

  * ``rte_bit_[test|set|clear|assign|flip]`` functions provide excellent
    performance (by avoiding restricting the compiler and CPU), but give
    no guarantees in relation to memory ordering or atomicity.

  * ``rte_bit_atomic_*`` provide atomic bit-level operations including
    the possibility to specify memory ordering constraints.

  The new public API elements are polymorphic, using the _Generic-based
  macros (for C) and function overloading (in C++ translation units).

* **Added multi-word bitset API.**

  Introduced a new multi-word bitset API to the EAL.

  The RTE bitset is optimized for scenarios where the bitset size exceeds the
  capacity of a single word (e.g., larger than 64 bits), but is not large
  enough to justify the overhead and complexity of the more scalable,
  yet slower, ``<rte_bitmap.h>`` API.

  This addition provides an efficient and straightforward alternative
  for handling bitsets of intermediate size.

* **Added a per-lcore static memory allocation facility.**

  Added EAL API ``<rte_lcore_var.h>`` for statically allocating small,
  frequently-accessed data structures, for which one instance should exist
  for each EAL thread and registered non-EAL thread.

  With lcore variables, data is organized spatially on a per-lcore id basis,
  rather than per library or PMD, avoiding the need for cache aligning
  (or RTE_CACHE_GUARDing) data structures, which in turn
  reduces CPU cache internal fragmentation and improves performance.

  Lcore variables are similar to thread-local storage (TLS, e.g. C11 ``_Thread_local``),
  but decouples the values' life times from those of the threads.

* **Extended service cores statistics.**

  Two new per-service counters are added to the service cores framework.

  * ``RTE_SERVICE_ATTR_IDLE_CALL_COUNT`` tracks the number of service function
    invocations where no actual work was performed.

  * ``RTE_SERVICE_ATTR_ERROR_CALL_COUNT`` tracks the number of invocations
    resulting in an error.

  The new statistics are useful for debugging and profiling.

* **Hardened rte_malloc and related functions.**

  Added function attributes to ``rte_malloc`` and similar functions
  that can catch some obvious bugs at compile time (with GCC 11.0 or later).
  For example, calling ``free`` on a pointer that was allocated with ``rte_malloc``
  (and vice versa); freeing the same pointer twice in the same routine or
  freeing an object that was not created by allocation.

* **Updated logging library.**

  * The log subsystem is initialized earlier in startup so all messages go through the library.

  * If the application is a systemd service and the log output is being sent to standard error
    then DPDK will switch to journal native protocol.
    This allows more data such as severity to be sent.

  * The syslog option has changed.
    By default, messages are no longer sent to syslog unless the ``--syslog`` option is specified.
    Syslog is also supported on FreeBSD (but not on Windows).

  * Log messages can be timestamped with ``--log-timestamp`` option.

  * Log messages can be colorized with the ``--log-color`` option.

* **Updated Marvell cnxk mempool driver.**

  * Added mempool driver support for CN20K SoC.

* **Added more ICMP message types and codes.**

  Added new ICMP message types and codes from RFC 792 in ``rte_icmp.h``.

* **Added IPv6 address structure and related utilities.**

  A new IPv6 address structure is now available in ``rte_ip6.h``.
  It comes with a set of helper functions and macros.

* **Added link speed lanes API.**

  Added functions to query or force the link lanes configuration.

* **Added Ethernet device clock frequency adjustment.**

  Added the function ``rte_eth_timesync_adjust_freq``
  to adjust the clock frequency for Ethernet devices.

* **Extended flow table index features.**

  * Extended the flow table insertion type enum with the
    ``RTE_FLOW_TABLE_INSERTION_TYPE_INDEX_WITH_PATTERN`` type.
  * Added a function for inserting a flow rule by index with pattern:
    ``rte_flow_async_create_by_index_with_pattern()``.
  * Added a flow action to redirect packets to a particular index in a flow table:
    ``RTE_FLOW_ACTION_TYPE_JUMP_TO_TABLE_INDEX``.

* **Added support for dumping registers with names and filtering by modules.**

  Added a new function ``rte_eth_dev_get_reg_info_ext()``
  to filter the registers by module names and get the information
  (names, values and other attributes) of the filtered registers.

* **Updated Amazon ENA (Elastic Network Adapter) net driver.**

  * Modified the PMD API that controls the LLQ header policy.
  * Replaced ``enable_llq``, ``normal_llq_hdr`` and ``large_llq_hdr`` devargs
    with a new shared devarg ``llq_policy`` that maintains the same logic.
  * Added a validation check for Rx packet descriptor consistency.

Removed Items
-------------

* ethdev: Removed the ``__rte_ethdev_trace_rx_burst`` symbol, as the corresponding
  tracepoint was split into two separate ones for empty and non-empty calls.


API Changes
-----------

* kvargs: reworked the process API.

  * The already existing ``rte_kvargs_process`` now only handles ``key=value`` cases and
    rejects input where only a key is present in the parsed string.
  * ``rte_kvargs_process_opt`` has been added to behave as ``rte_kvargs_process`` in previous
    releases: it handles key=value and only-key cases.
  * Both ``rte_kvargs_process`` and ``rte_kvargs_process_opt`` reject a NULL ``kvlist`` parameter.

ABI Changes
-----------

* eal: The maximum number of file descriptors that can be passed to a secondary process
  has been increased from 8 to 253 (which is the maximum possible with Unix domain sockets).
  This allows for more queues when using software devices such as TAP and XDP.

* ethdev: Added ``filter`` and ``names`` fields to ``rte_dev_reg_info`` structure
  for filtering by modules and reporting names of registers.

* cryptodev: The queue pair configuration structure ``rte_cryptodev_qp_conf``
  is updated to have a new parameter to set priority of that particular queue pair.

* cryptodev: The list end enumerators ``RTE_CRYPTO_ASYM_XFORM_TYPE_LIST_END``
  and ``RTE_CRYPTO_RSA_PADDING_TYPE_LIST_END`` are removed
  to allow subsequent addition of new asymmetric algorithms and RSA padding types.

* cryptodev: The enum ``rte_crypto_asym_xform_type`` and struct ``rte_crypto_asym_op``
  are updated to include new values to support EdDSA.

* cryptodev: The ``rte_crypto_rsa_xform`` struct member to hold private key data
  in either exponent or quintuple format is changed from a union to a struct data type.
  This change is to support ASN.1 syntax (RFC 3447 Appendix A.1.2).

* cryptodev: The padding struct ``rte_crypto_rsa_padding`` is moved
  from ``rte_crypto_rsa_op_param`` to ``rte_crypto_rsa_xform``
  as the padding information is part of session creation
  instead of the per packet crypto operation.
  This change is required to support virtio-crypto specifications.

* bbdev: The structure ``rte_bbdev_stats`` was updated to add a new parameter
  to optionally report the number of enqueue batches available ``enqueue_depth_avail``.

* dmadev: Added ``nb_priorities`` field to the ``rte_dma_info`` structure
  and ``priority`` field to the ``rte_dma_conf`` structure
  to get device supported priority levels
  and configure required priority from the application.

* eventdev: Added the ``preschedule_type`` field to ``rte_event_dev_config`` structure.

* eventdev: Removed the single-event enqueue and dequeue function pointers
  from ``rte_event_fp_fps``.

* graph: To accommodate node specific xstats counters, added ``xstat_cntrs``,
  ``xstat_desc`` and ``xstat_count`` to ``rte_graph_cluster_node_stats``,
  added new structure ``rte_node_xstats`` to ``rte_node_register`` and
  added ``xstat_off`` to ``rte_node``.

* graph: The members ``dispatch`` and ``xstat_off`` of the structure ``rte_node``
  have been marked as ``RTE_CACHE_LINE_MIN_SIZE`` bytes aligned.
