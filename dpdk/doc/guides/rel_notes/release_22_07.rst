DPDK Release 22.07
==================

New Features
------------

* **Added initial RISC-V architecture support.**

  Added EAL implementation for RISC-V architecture.
  The initial device the porting was tested on was
  a HiFive Unmatched development board based on the SiFive Freedom U740 SoC.
  In theory this implementation should work
  with any ``rv64gc`` ISA compatible implementation
  with MMU supporting a reasonable address space size (U740 uses sv39 MMU).

* **Added Sequence Lock.**

  Added a new synchronization primitive: the sequence lock
  (seqlock). A seqlock allows for low overhead, parallel reads. The
  DPDK seqlock uses a spinlock to serialize multiple writing threads.

* **Added function to get random floating point number.**

  Added the function ``rte_drand()`` to provide a pseudo-random
  floating point number.

* **Added protocol based input color selection for meter.**

  Added new functions ``rte_mtr_color_in_protocol_set()``,
  ``rte_mtr_color_in_protocol_get()``,
  ``rte_mtr_color_in_protocol_priority_get()``,
  ``rte_mtr_meter_vlan_table_update()``
  and updated ``struct rte_mtr_params`` and ``struct rte_mtr_capabilities`` to
  support protocol based input color selection for meter.

* **Added Rx queue available descriptors threshold and event.**

  Added ethdev API and corresponding driver operations to set Rx queue
  available descriptors threshold and query for queues that have reached the
  threshold when a new event ``RTE_ETH_EVENT_RX_AVAIL_THRESH`` is received.

* **Added telemetry for module EEPROM.**

  Added telemetry command to dump module EEPROM.
  Added support for module EEPROM information format defined in:

    * SFF-8079 revision 1.7
    * SFF-8472 revision 12.0
    * SFF-8636 revision 2.7

* **Added vhost API to get the number of in-flight packets.**

  Added an API which can get the number of in-flight packets in
  the vhost async data path without using lock.

* **Added vhost async dequeue API to receive packets from guest.**

  Added vhost async dequeue API which can leverage DMA devices to
  accelerate receiving packets from a guest.
  Both split and packed virtqueues are supported.

* **Added thread-safe version of in-flight packet clear API in vhost library.**

  Added an API which can clear the in-flight packets submitted to
  the async channel in a thread-safe manner, in the vhost async data path.

* **Added vhost API to get the device type of a vDPA device.**

  Added an API which can get the device type of vDPA devices.

* **Updated NVIDIA mlx5 vDPA driver.**

  * Added new devargs options ``queue_size`` and ``queues``
    to allow prior creation of virtq resources.
  * Added new devargs option ``max_conf_threads``
    defining the number of management threads for parallel configurations.

* **Updated Amazon ENA driver to version 2.7.0.**

  * Added fast mbuf free feature support.
  * Added ``enable_llq`` device argument for controlling the PMD LLQ
    (Low Latency Queue) mode.

* **Updated Atomic Rules' Arkville PMD.**

  * A firmware version update to Arkville 22.07 is required.
  * Added support for Atomic Rules PCI device IDs ``0x101a, 0x101b, 0x101c``.
  * Added PMD support for virtual functions and vfio_pci driver.

  * Added ``DEV_RX_OFFLOAD_TIMESTAMP`` support.
  * Added Protocol Agnostic Flow Offloading support in AVF FDIR and RSS.

* **Updated Intel ice driver.**

  * Added support for RSS RETA configure in DCF mode.
  * Added support for RSS HASH configure in DCF mode.
  * Added support for MTU configure in DCF mode.
  * Added support for promisc configuration in DCF mode.
  * Added support for MAC configuration in DCF mode.
  * Added support for VLAN filter and offload configuration in DCF mode.
  * Added Tx QoS queue / queue group rate limitation configure support.
  * Added Tx QoS queue / queue group priority configuration support.
  * Added Tx QoS queue weight configuration support.

    * Increased maximum MTU up to 9190;
    * Increased maximum number of Rx and Tx queues;
    * Removed power-of-two limitations on Rx and Tx queue size;
    * Extended interrupt structures (required for additional queues).

* **Updated Wangxun ngbe driver.**

  * Added support for yt8531s PHY.
  * Added support for OEM subsystem vendor ID.
  * Added autoneg on/off for external PHY SFI mode.

* **Added Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) algorithm in cryptodev.**

  Added support for Elliptic Curve Diffie Hellman (ECDH) asymmetric
  algorithm in cryptodev.

* **Updated OpenSSL crypto driver with 3.0 EVP API.**

  Updated OpenSSL driver to support OpenSSL v3.0 EVP API.
  Backward compatibility with OpenSSL v1.1.1 is also maintained.

* **Updated Marvell cnxk crypto driver.**

  Added telemetry callback functions which allow for a list of DMA devices,
  statistics and other DMA device information to be queried.

* **Added scalar version of the LPM library.**

  Added scalar implementation of ``rte_lpm_lookupx4``.
  This is a fall-back implementation for platforms that
  don't support vector operations.

* **Merged l3fwd-acl into l3fwd example.**

  Merged l3fwd-acl code into l3fwd as l3fwd-acl contains duplicate
  and common functions to l3fwd.

* **Renamed L2 payload RSS type in testpmd.**

  Renamed RSS type ``ether`` to ``l2-payload`` for ``port config all rss``
  command.


API Changes
-----------

* The DPDK header file ``rte_altivec.h``,
  which is a wrapper for the PPC header file ``altivec.h``,
  undefines the AltiVec keyword ``vector``.
  The alternative keyword ``__vector`` should be used instead.

* Experimental structures ``struct rte_mtr_params``
  and ``struct rte_mtr_capabilities`` were updated to support
  protocol based input color for meter.


ABI Changes
-----------

* No ABI change that would break compatibility with 21.11.
