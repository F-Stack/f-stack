DPDK Release 20.11
==================

New Features
------------

* **Added write combining store APIs.**

  Added ``rte_write32_wc`` and ``rte_write32_wc_relaxed`` APIs
  that enable write combining stores (depending on architecture).
  The functions are provided as a generic stub and
  x86 specific implementation.

* **Added prefetch with intention to write APIs.**

  Added new prefetch function variants e.g. ``rte_prefetch0_write``,
  which allow the programmer to prefetch a cache line and also indicate
  the intention to write.

* **Added the rte_cldemote API.**

  Added a hardware hint CLDEMOTE, which is similar to prefetch in reverse.
  CLDEMOTE moves the cache line to the more remote cache, where it expects
  sharing to be efficient. Moving the cache line to a level more distant from
  the processor helps to accelerate core-to-core communication.
  This API is specific to x86 and implemented as a stub for other
  architectures.

* **Added support for limiting maximum SIMD bitwidth.**

  Added a new EAL config setting ``max_simd_bitwidth`` to limit the vector
  path selection at runtime. This value can be set by apps using the
  ``rte_vect_set_max_simd_bitwidth`` function, or by the user with EAL flag
  ``--force-max-simd-bitwidth``.

* **Added zero copy APIs for rte_ring.**

  For rings with producer/consumer in ``RTE_RING_SYNC_ST``, ``RTE_RING_SYNC_MT_HTS``
  modes, these APIs split enqueue/dequeue operation into three phases
  (enqueue/dequeue start, copy data to/from ring, enqueue/dequeue finish).
  Along with the advantages of the peek APIs, these provide the ability to
  copy the data to the ring memory directly without the need for temporary
  storage.

* **Updated CRC modules of the net library.**

  * Added runtime selection of the optimal architecture-specific CRC path.
  * Added optimized implementations of CRC32-Ethernet and CRC16-CCITT
    using the AVX512 and VPCLMULQDQ instruction sets.

* **Introduced extended buffer description for receiving.**

  Added the extended Rx buffer description for Rx queue setup routine
  providing the individual settings for each Rx segment with maximal size,
  buffer offset and memory pool to allocate data buffers from.

* **Added the FEC API, for a generic FEC query and config.**

  Added the FEC API which provides functions for query FEC capabilities and
  current FEC mode from device. An API for configuring FEC mode is also provided.

* **Added thread safety to rte_flow functions.**

  Added the ``RTE_ETH_DEV_FLOW_OPS_THREAD_SAFE`` device flag to indicate
  whether a PMD supports thread safe operations. If the PMD doesn't set the flag,
  the rte_flow API level functions will protect the flow operations with a mutex.

* **Added flow-based traffic sampling support.**

  Added a new action ``RTE_FLOW_ACTION_TYPE_SAMPLE`` that will sample the
  incoming traffic and send a duplicated traffic with the specified ratio to
  the application, while the original packet will continue to the target
  destination.

  The packets sampling is '1/ratio'. A ratio value set to 1 means that the
  packets will be completely mirrored. The sample packet can be assigned with
  a different set of actions than the original packet.

* **Added support of shared action in flow API.**

  Added shared action support to use single flow actions in multiple flow
  rules. An update to the shared action configuration alters the behavior of all
  flow rules using it.

  * Added a new action: ``RTE_FLOW_ACTION_TYPE_SHARED`` to use shared action
    as a flow action.
  * Added new flow APIs to create/update/destroy/query shared actions.

* **Added support to flow rules to allow private PMD items/actions.**

  * Flow rule verification has been  updated to accept private PMD
    items and actions.

* **Added a generic API to offload tunneled traffic and restore missed packets.**

  * Added a new hardware independent helper to the flow API that
    offloads tunneled traffic and restores missed packets.

* **Updated the ethdev library to support hairpin between two ports.**

  New APIs have been introduced to support binding / unbinding of 2 ports in a
  hairpin configuration. The hairpin Tx part flow rules can be inserted
  explicitly. A new API has been added to get the hairpin peer ports list.

    items matching as well.
  * Added header modify actions.
  * Added flag action.

    where N represents the hexadecimal bitmask of the ports used.

* **Added raw data-path APIs for cryptodev library.**

  Added raw data-path APIs to Cryptodev to help accelerate external libraries
  or applications which need to avail of fast cryptodev enqueue/dequeue
  operations but which do not necessarily need to depend on mbufs and
  cryptodev operation mempools.

    more information, see `Introducing the Intel Data Streaming Accelerator
    (Intel DSA)
    <https://01.org/blogs/2019/introducing-intel-data-streaming-accelerator>`_.
  * Added support for the fill operation via the API ``rte_ioat_enqueue_fill()``,
    where the hardware fills an area of memory with a repeating pattern.
  * Added a per-device configuration flag to disable management
    of user-provided completion handles.
  * Renamed the ``rte_ioat_do_copies()`` API to ``rte_ioat_perform_ops()``,
    and renamed the ``rte_ioat_completed_copies()`` API to ``rte_ioat_completed_ops()``
    to better reflect the APIs' purposes, and remove the implication that
    they are limited to copy operations only.
    Note: The old API is still provided but marked as deprecated in the code.
  * Added a new API ``rte_ioat_fence()`` to add a fence between operations.
    This API replaces the ``fence`` flag parameter in the ``rte_ioat_enqueue_copies()`` function,
    and is clearer as there is no ambiguity as to whether the flag should be
    set on the last operation before the fence or the first operation after it.

* **Updated the pipeline library for alignment with the P4 language.**

  Added a new Software Switch (SWX) pipeline type that provides more
  flexibility through APIs and feature alignment with the P4 language.
  Some enhancements are:

  * The packet headers, meta-data, actions, tables and pipelines are
    dynamically defined instead of selected from a pre-defined set.

    the user to specify the destination mac address for each ethernet port
    used.
  * Replaced ``--scalar`` command-line option with ``--alg=<value>``, to allow
    the user to select the desired classify method.

* **Updated vhost sample application.**

  Added vhost asynchronous APIs support, which demonstrates how the application
  can leverage IOAT DMA channels with vhost asynchronous APIs.
  See the :doc:`../sample_app_ug/vhost` for more details.

  ``rte_get_main_lcore()``. The old function is deprecated.

  The iterator for worker lcores is also changed:
  ``RTE_LCORE_FOREACH_SLAVE`` is replaced with
  ``RTE_LCORE_FOREACH_WORKER``.

* eal: The definitions related to including and excluding devices
  have been changed from blacklist/whitelist to block/allow list.
  There are compatibility macros and command line mapping to accept
  the old values but applications and scripts are strongly encouraged
  to migrate to the new names.

* eal: The ``rte_logs`` struct and global symbol was made private
  and is no longer part of the API.

* eal: Made the ``rte_dev_event`` structure private to the EAL as no public API
  used it.

* eal: ``rte_cio_rmb()`` and ``rte_cio_wmb()`` were deprecated since 20.08
  and are removed in this release.

* mem: Removed the unioned field ``phys_addr`` from
  the structures ``rte_memseg`` and ``rte_memzone``.
  The field ``iova`` remains from the old unions.

* mempool: Removed the unioned fields ``phys_addr`` and ``physaddr`` from
  the structures ``rte_mempool_memhdr`` and ``rte_mempool_objhdr``.
  The field ``iova`` remains from the old unions.
  The flag name ``MEMPOOL_F_NO_PHYS_CONTIG`` is removed,
  while the aliased flag ``MEMPOOL_F_NO_IOVA_CONTIG`` is kept.

* mbuf: Removed the functions ``rte_mbuf_data_dma_addr*``
  and the macros ``rte_pktmbuf_mtophys*``.
  The same functionality is still available with the functions and macros
  having ``iova`` in their names instead of ``dma_addr`` or ``mtophys``.

  from the structure ``rte_mbuf``. It is replaced with dynamic fields.

* mbuf: Removed the field ``seqn`` from the structure ``rte_mbuf``.
  It is replaced with dynamic fields.

* mbuf: Removed the field ``timestamp`` from the structure ``rte_mbuf``.
  It is replaced with the dynamic field RTE_MBUF_DYNFIELD_TIMESTAMP_NAME
  which was previously used only for Tx.

* pci: Removed the ``rte_kernel_driver`` enum defined in rte_dev.h and
  replaced with a private enum in the PCI subsystem.

* pci: Removed the PCI resources map API from the public API
  (``pci_map_resource`` and ``pci_unmap_resource``) and moved it to the
  PCI bus driver along with the PCI resources lists and associated structures
  (``pci_map``, ``pci_msix_table``, ``mapped_pci_resource`` and
  ``mapped_pci_res_list``).

* ethdev: Removed the ``kdrv`` field in the ethdev ``rte_eth_dev_data``
  structure as it gave no useful abstracted information to the applications.

* ethdev: ``rte_eth_rx_descriptor_done()`` API has been deprecated.

* ethdev: Renamed basic statistics per queue. An underscore is inserted
  between the queue number and the rest of the xstat name:

  * ``rx_qN*`` -> ``rx_qN_*``
  * ``tx_qN*`` -> ``tx_qN_*``

* ethdev: Added capability to query age flow action.

* ethdev: Changed ``rte_eth_dev_stop`` return value from ``void`` to
  ``int`` to provide a way to report various error conditions.

* ethdev: Modified field type of ``base`` and ``nb_queue`` in struct
  ``rte_eth_dcb_tc_queue_mapping`` from ``uint8_t`` to ``uint16_t``.
  As the data of ``uint8_t`` will be truncated when queue number in
  a TC is greater than 256.

* ethdev: Removed the legacy filter API, including
  ``rte_eth_dev_filter_supported()`` and ``rte_eth_dev_filter_ctrl()``.

* ethdev: Removed the legacy L2 tunnel configuration API, including
  ``rte_eth_dev_l2_tunnel_eth_type_conf()`` and
  ``rte_eth_dev_l2_tunnel_offload_set()``..

* vhost: Moved vDPA APIs from experimental to stable.

* vhost: Add a new function ``rte_vhost_crypto_driver_start`` to be called
  instead of ``rte_vhost_driver_start`` by crypto applications.

* cryptodev: The structure ``rte_crypto_sym_vec`` is updated to support both
  cpu_crypto synchronous operations and asynchronous raw data-path APIs.

* cryptodev: ``RTE_CRYPTO_AEAD_LIST_END`` from ``enum rte_crypto_aead_algorithm``,
  ``RTE_CRYPTO_CIPHER_LIST_END`` from ``enum rte_crypto_cipher_algorithm`` and
  ``RTE_CRYPTO_AUTH_LIST_END`` from ``enum rte_crypto_auth_algorithm``
  are removed to avoid future ABI breakage while adding new algorithms.

* scheduler: Renamed functions ``rte_cryptodev_scheduler_slave_attach``,
  ``rte_cryptodev_scheduler_slave_detach`` and
  ``rte_cryptodev_scheduler_slaves_get`` to
  ``rte_cryptodev_scheduler_worker_attach``,
  ``rte_cryptodev_scheduler_worker_detach`` and
  ``rte_cryptodev_scheduler_workers_get`` accordingly.

* scheduler: Renamed the configuration value
  ``RTE_CRYPTODEV_SCHEDULER_MAX_NB_SLAVES`` to
  ``RTE_CRYPTODEV_SCHEDULER_MAX_NB_WORKERS``.

* security: The ``hfn_ovrd`` field in ``rte_security_pdcp_xform`` is changed from
  ``uint32_t`` to ``uint8_t`` so that a new field ``sdap_enabled`` can be added
  to support SDAP.

* security: The API ``rte_security_session_create`` is updated to take two
  mempool objects: one for session and other for session private data.
  So the application need to create two mempools and get the size of session
  private data using API ``rte_security_session_get_size`` for private session
  mempool.

* ipsec: ``RTE_SATP_LOG2_NUM`` has been dropped from ``enum`` and
  subsequently moved ``rte_ipsec`` lib from experimental to stable.

* baseband/fpga_lte_fec: Renamed function ``fpga_lte_fec_configure`` to
  ``rte_fpga_lte_fec_configure`` and structure ``fpga_lte_fec_conf`` to
  ``rte_fpga_lte_fec_conf``.

* baseband/fpga_5gnr_fec: Renamed function ``fpga_5gnr_fec_configure`` to
  ``rte_fpga_5gnr_fec_configure`` and structure ``fpga_5gnr_fec_conf`` to
  ``rte_fpga_5gnr_fec_conf``.

* rawdev: Added a structure size parameter to the functions
  ``rte_rawdev_queue_setup()``, ``rte_rawdev_queue_conf_get()``,
  ``rte_rawdev_info_get()`` and ``rte_rawdev_configure()``,
  allowing limited driver type-checking and ABI compatibility.

* rawdev: Changed the return type of the function ``rte_dev_info_get()``
  and the function ``rte_rawdev_queue_conf_get()``
  from ``void`` to ``int`` allowing the return of error codes from drivers.

* rawdev: The running of a drivers ``selftest()`` function can now be done
  using the ``rawdev_autotest`` command in the ``dpdk-test`` binary. This
  command now calls the self-test function for each rawdev found on the
  system, and does not require a specific command per device type.
  Following this change, the ``ioat_rawdev_autotest`` command has been
  removed as no longer needed.

* raw/ioat: As noted above, the ``rte_ioat_do_copies()`` and
  ``rte_ioat_completed_copies()`` functions have been renamed to
  ``rte_ioat_perform_ops()`` and ``rte_ioat_completed_ops()`` respectively.

* stack: the experimental tag has been dropped from the stack library, and its
  interfaces are considered stable as of DPDK 20.11.

* bpf: ``RTE_BPF_XTYPE_NUM`` has been dropped from ``rte_bpf_xtype``.

* gso: Changed ``rte_gso_segment`` behaviour and return value:

  * ``pkt`` is not saved to ``pkts_out[0]`` if not GSOed.
  * Return 0 instead of 1 for the above case.
  * ``pkt`` is not freed, no matter whether it is GSOed, leaving to the caller.

* acl: ``RTE_ACL_CLASSIFY_NUM`` enum value has been removed.
  This enum value was not used inside DPDK, while it prevented the addition of new
  classify algorithms without causing an ABI breakage.

* sched: Added ``subport_profile_id`` as an argument
  to function ``rte_sched_subport_config``.

* sched: Removed ``tb_rate``, ``tc_rate``, ``tc_period`` and ``tb_size``
  from ``struct rte_sched_subport_params``.


ABI Changes
-----------

* eal: Removed the unimplemented function ``rte_dump_registers()``.

* ``ethdev`` changes

  * The following device operation function pointers moved
    from ``struct eth_dev_ops`` to ``struct rte_eth_dev``:

    * ``eth_rx_queue_count_t       rx_queue_count;``
    * ``eth_rx_descriptor_done_t   rx_descriptor_done;``
    * ``eth_rx_descriptor_status_t rx_descriptor_status;``
    * ``eth_tx_descriptor_status_t tx_descriptor_status;``

  * ``struct eth_dev_ops`` is no longer accessible by applications,
    which was already an internal data structure.

  * ``ethdev`` internal functions are marked with ``__rte_internal`` tag.

  * Added extensions' attributes to struct ``rte_flow_item_ipv6``.
    A set of additional values added to struct, indicating the existence of
    every defined extension header type.
    Applications should use the new values for identification of existing
    extensions in the packet header.

  * Added fields ``rx_seg`` and ``rx_nseg`` to ``rte_eth_rxconf`` structure
    to provide extended description of the receiving buffer.

  * ``struct rte_eth_hairpin_conf`` has two new members:

    * ``uint32_t tx_explicit:1;``
    * ``uint32_t manual_bind:1;``

  * Added new field ``has_vlan`` to structure ``rte_flow_item_eth``,
    indicating that packet header contains at least one VLAN.

  * Added new field ``has_more_vlan`` to the structure
    ``rte_flow_item_vlan``, indicating that packet header contains
    at least one more VLAN, after this VLAN.

* eventdev: The following structures are modified to support DLB/DLB2 PMDs
  and future extensions:

  * ``rte_event_dev_info``
  * ``rte_event_dev_config``
  * ``rte_event_port_conf``

* sched: Added new fields to ``struct rte_sched_subport_port_params``.

* lpm: Removed fields other than ``tbl24`` and ``tbl8`` from the struct
  ``rte_lpm``. The removed fields were made internal.
