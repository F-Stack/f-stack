DPDK Release 19.11
==================

New Features
------------

* **Added support for --base-virtaddr EAL option to FreeBSD.**

  The FreeBSD version of DPDK now also supports setting base virtual address
  for mapping pages and resources into its address space.

* **Added Lock-free Stack for aarch64.**

  Enabled the lock-free stack implementation for aarch64 platforms.

* **Extended pktmbuf mempool private structure.**

  rte_pktmbuf_pool_private structure was extended to include flags field
  for future compatibility.
  As per 19.11 release this field is reserved and should be set to 0
  by the user.

+* **Changed mempool allocation behavior.**

  Changed the mempool allocation behaviour so that objects no longer cross
  pages by default. Note, this may consume more memory when using small memory
  pages.

* **Added support for dynamic fields and flags in mbuf.**

  This new feature adds the ability to dynamically register some room
  for a field or a flag in the mbuf structure. This is typically used
  for specific offload features, where adding a static field or flag
  in the mbuf is not justified.

* **Added support for hairpin queues.**

  On supported NICs, we can now setup hairpin queues which will offload packets
  from the wire, back to the wire.

* **Added flow tag in rte_flow.**

  The ``SET_TAG`` action and ``TAG`` item have been added to support transient
  flow tag.

* **Extended metadata support in rte_flow.**

  Flow metadata has been extended to both Rx and Tx.

  * Tx metadata can also be set by SET_META action of rte_flow.
  * Rx metadata is delivered to the host via a dynamic field of ``rte_mbuf``
    with ``PKT_RX_DYNF_METADATA``.

* **Added ethdev API to set supported packet types.**

  * Added new API ``rte_eth_dev_set_ptypes`` which allows an application to
    inform a PMD about a reduced range of packet types to handle.
  * This scheme will allow PMDs to avoid lookup of internal ptype table on Rx
    and thereby improve Rx performance if the application wishes to do so.

* **Added Rx offload flag to enable or disable RSS update.**

  * Added new Rx offload flag ``DEV_RX_OFFLOAD_RSS_HASH`` which can be used to
    enable/disable PMDs write to ``rte_mbuf::hash::rss``.
  * PMDs notify the validity of ``rte_mbuf::hash:rss`` to the application
    by enabling ``PKT_RX_RSS_HASH`` flag in ``rte_mbuf::ol_flags``.

* **Added Rx/Tx packet burst mode "get" API.**

  Added two new functions ``rte_eth_rx_burst_mode_get`` and
  ``rte_eth_tx_burst_mode_get`` that allow an application
  to retrieve the mode information about Rx/Tx packet burst
  such as Scalar or Vector, and Vector technology like AVX2.

* **Added Hisilicon hns3 PMD.**

  Added the new ``hns3`` net driver for the inbuilt Hisilicon Network
  Subsystem 3 (HNS3) network engine found in the Hisilicon Kunpeng 920 SoC.
  See the :doc:`../nics/hns3` guide for more details on this new driver.

* **Added NXP PFE PMD.**

  Added the new PFE driver for the NXP LS1012A platform. See the
  :doc:`../nics/pfe` NIC driver guide for more details on this new driver.

  * Enabled zero copy between application mempools and UMEM by enabling the
    ``XDP_UMEM_UNALIGNED_CHUNKS UMEM`` flag.

* **Added cryptodev asymmetric session-less operation.**

  Added a session-less option to the cryptodev asymmetric structure. It works
  the same way as symmetric crypto, and the corresponding transform is used
  directly by the crypto operation.

* **Added Marvell NITROX symmetric crypto PMD.**

  Added a symmetric crypto PMD for Marvell NITROX V security processor.

* **Enabled Single Pass GCM acceleration on QAT GEN3.**

  Added support for Single Pass GCM, available on QAT GEN3 only (Intel
  QuickAssist Technology P5xxx). It is automatically chosen instead of the
  classic 2-pass mode when running on QAT GEN3, significantly improving
  the performance of AES GCM operations.

* **Updated the Intel QuickAssist Technology (QAT) asymmetric crypto PMD.**

  * Added support for asymmetric session-less operations.
  * Added support for RSA algorithm with pair ``(n, d)`` private key
    representation.
  * Added support for RSA algorithm with quintuple private key representation.

* **Updated the Intel QuickAssist Technology (QAT) compression PMD.**

  Added stateful decompression support in the Intel QuickAssist Technology PMD.
  Please note that stateful compression is not supported.

* **Added external buffers support for dpdk-test-compress-perf tool.**

  Added a command line option to the ``dpdk-test-compress-perf`` tool to
  allocate and use memory zones as external buffers instead of keeping the
  data directly in mbuf areas.

* **Updated the IPSec library.**

  * Added Security Associations (SA) Database API to ``librte_ipsec``. A new
    test-sad application has also been introduced to evaluate and perform
    custom functional and performance tests for an IPsec SAD implementation.

  * Support fragmented packets in inline crypto processing mode with fallback
    ``lookaside-none`` session. Corresponding changes are also added in the
    IPsec Security Gateway application.

* **Introduced FIFO for NTB PMD.**

  Introduced FIFO for NTB (Non-transparent Bridge) PMD to support
  packet based processing.

* **Added eBPF JIT support for arm64.**

  Added eBPF JIT support for arm64 architecture to improve the eBPF program
  performance.

* **Added RIB and FIB (Routing/Forwarding Information Base) libraries.**

  Added Routing and Forwarding Information Base (RIB/FIB) libraries. RIB and
  FIB can replace the LPM (Longest Prefix Match) library with better control
  plane (RIB) performance. The data plane (FIB) can be extended with new
  algorithms.

* **Updated testpmd with a command for ptypes.**

  * Added a console command to testpmd app, ``show port (port_id) ptypes`` which
    gives ability to print port supported ptypes in different protocol layers.
  * Packet type detection disabled by default for the supported PMDs.

* **Added new l2fwd-event sample application.**

  Added an example application ``l2fwd-event`` that adds event device support to
  the traditional l2fwd example. It demonstrates usage of poll and event mode IO
  mechanism under a single application.

* **Added build support for Link Time Optimization.**

  LTO is an optimization technique used by the compiler to perform whole
  program analysis and optimization at link time.  In order to do that
  compilers store their internal representation of the source code that
  the linker uses at the final stage of the compilation process.

  See :doc:`../prog_guide/lto` for more information:

* **Added IOVA as VA support for KNI.**

  * Added IOVA = VA support for KNI. KNI can operate in IOVA = VA mode when
    ``iova-mode=va`` EAL option is passed to the application or when bus IOVA
    scheme is selected as RTE_IOVA_VA. This mode only works on Linux Kernel
    versions 4.10.0 and above.

  * Due to IOVA to KVA address translations, based on the KNI use case there
    can be a performance impact. For mitigation, forcing IOVA to PA via EAL
    ``--iova-mode=pa`` option can be used, IOVA_DC bus iommu scheme can also
    result in IOVA as PA.


Removed Items
-------------

* Removed library-level ABI versions. These have been replaced with a single
  project-level ABI version for non-experimental libraries and an ABI version of
  ``0`` for experimental libraries. Review the :doc:`../contributing/abi_policy`
  and :doc:`../contributing/abi_versioning` guides for more information.

* Removed duplicated set of commands for Rx offload configuration from testpmd::

    port config all crc-strip|scatter|rx-cksum|rx-timestamp|
                    hw-vlan|hw-vlan-filter|hw-vlan-strip|hw-vlan-extend on|off

  The testpmd command set that can be used instead in order to enable or
  disable Rx offloading on all Rx queues of a port is::

    port config <port_id> rx_offload crc_strip|scatter|
                                     ipv4_cksum|udp_cksum|tcp_cksum|timestamp|
                                     vlan_strip|vlan_filter|vlan_extend on|off

* Removed AF_XDP pmd_zero copy vdev argument. Support is now auto-detected.

* The following sample applications have been removed in this release:

  * Exception Path
  * L3 Forwarding in a Virtualization Environment
  * Load Balancer
  * Netmap Compatibility
  * Quota and Watermark
  * vhost-scsi

* Removed arm64-dpaa2-* build config. arm64-dpaa-* can now build for both
  dpaa and dpaa2 platforms.


API Changes
-----------

* eal: made the ``lcore_config`` struct and global symbol private.

* eal: removed the ``rte_cpu_check_supported`` function, replaced by
  ``rte_cpu_is_supported`` since dpdk v17.08.

* eal: removed the ``rte_malloc_virt2phy`` function, replaced by
  ``rte_malloc_virt2iova`` since v17.11.

* eal: made the ``rte_config`` struct and ``rte_eal_get_configuration``
  function private.

* mem: hid the internal ``malloc_heap`` structure and the
  ``rte_malloc_heap.h`` header.

* vfio: removed ``rte_vfio_dma_map`` and ``rte_vfio_dma_unmap`` that have
  been marked as deprecated in release 19.05.
  ``rte_vfio_container_dma_map`` and ``rte_vfio_container_dma_unmap`` can
  be used as substitutes.

* pci: removed the following functions deprecated since dpdk v17.11:

  - ``eal_parse_pci_BDF`` replaced by ``rte_pci_addr_parse``
  - ``eal_parse_pci_DomBDF`` replaced by ``rte_pci_addr_parse``
  - ``rte_eal_compare_pci_addr`` replaced by ``rte_pci_addr_cmp``

* The network structure ``esp_tail`` has been prefixed by ``rte_``.

* The network definitions of PPPoE ethertypes have been prefixed by ``RTE_``.

* The network structure for MPLS has been prefixed by ``rte_``.

* ethdev: changed ``rte_eth_dev_infos_get`` return value from ``void`` to
  ``int`` to provide a way to report various error conditions.

* ethdev: changed ``rte_eth_promiscuous_enable`` and
  ``rte_eth_promiscuous_disable`` return value from ``void`` to ``int`` to
  provide a way to report various error conditions.

* ethdev: changed ``rte_eth_allmulticast_enable`` and
  ``rte_eth_allmulticast_disable`` return value from ``void`` to ``int`` to
  provide a way to report various error conditions.

* ethdev: changed ``rte_eth_dev_xstats_reset`` return value from ``void`` to
  ``int`` to provide a way to report various error conditions.

* ethdev: changed ``rte_eth_link_get`` and ``rte_eth_link_get_nowait``
  return value from ``void`` to ``int`` to provide a way to report various
  error conditions.

* ethdev: changed ``rte_eth_macaddr_get`` return value from ``void`` to
  ``int`` to provide a way to report various error conditions.

* ethdev: changed ``rte_eth_dev_owner_delete`` return value from ``void`` to
  ``int`` to provide a way to report various error conditions.

* ethdev: The deprecated function ``rte_eth_dev_count`` was removed.
  The function ``rte_eth_dev_count_avail`` is a drop-in replacement.
  If the intent is to iterate over ports, ``RTE_ETH_FOREACH_*`` macros
  are better port iterators.

* ethdev: ``RTE_FLOW_ITEM_TYPE_META`` data endianness altered to host one.
  Due to the new dynamic metadata field in mbuf is host-endian either, there
  is a minor compatibility issue for applications in case of 32-bit values
  supported.

* ethdev: the tx_metadata mbuf field is moved to dynamic one.
  ``PKT_TX_METADATA`` flag is replaced with ``PKT_TX_DYNF_METADATA``.
  ``DEV_TX_OFFLOAD_MATCH_METADATA`` offload flag is removed, now metadata
  support in PMD is engaged on dynamic field registration.

* event: The function ``rte_event_eth_tx_adapter_enqueue`` takes an additional
  input as ``flags``. Flag ``RTE_EVENT_ETH_TX_ADAPTER_ENQUEUE_SAME_DEST`` which
  has been introduced in this release is used when all the packets enqueued in
  the Tx adapter are destined for the same Ethernet port and Tx queue.

* sched: The pipe nodes configuration parameters such as number of pipes,
  pipe queue sizes, pipe profiles, etc., are moved from port level structure
  to subport level. This allows different subports of the same port to
  have different configuration for the pipe nodes.


ABI Changes
-----------

* policy: Please note the revisions to the :doc:`../contributing/abi_policy`
  introducing major ABI versions, with DPDK 19.11 becoming the first major
  version ``v20``. ABI changes to add new features continue to be permitted in
  subsequent releases, with the condition that ABI compatibility with the major
  ABI version is maintained.

* net: The Ethernet address and other header definitions have changed
  attributes. They have been modified to be aligned on 2-byte boundaries.
  These changes should not impact normal usage because drivers naturally
  align the Ethernet header on receive and all known encapsulations
  preserve the alignment of the header.

* security: The field ``replay_win_sz`` has been moved from the ipsec library
  based ``rte_ipsec_sa_prm`` structure to security library based structure
  ``rte_security_ipsec_xform``, which specify the anti-replay window size
  to enable sequence replay attack handling.

* ipsec: The field ``replay_win_sz`` has been removed from the structure
  ``rte_ipsec_sa_prm`` as it has been added to the security library.

* ethdev: Added 32-bit fields for maximum LRO aggregated packet size, in
  struct ``rte_eth_dev_info`` for the port capability and in struct
  ``rte_eth_rxmode`` for the port configuration.
  Application should use the new field in struct ``rte_eth_rxmode`` to configure
  the requested size.
  PMD should use the new field in struct ``rte_eth_dev_info`` to report the
  supported port capability.
