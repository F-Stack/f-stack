Intel iFPGA driver
==================

This directory contains source code of Intel FPGA driver released by
the team which develops Intel FPGA Open Programmable Acceleration Engine (OPAE).
The directory of base/ contains the original source package. The base code
currently supports Intel FPGA solutions including integrated solution (Intel(R)
Xeon(R) CPU with FPGAs) and discrete solution (Intel(R) Programmable Acceleration
Card with Intel(R) Arria(R) 10 FPGA) and it could be extended to support more FPGA
devices in the future.

Please refer to [1][2] for more introduction on OPAE and Intel FPGAs.
