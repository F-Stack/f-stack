 *  @file lthread_api.h
 *
 *  @warning
 *  @b EXPERIMENTAL: this API may change without prior notice
 *
 *  This file contains the public API for the L-thread subsystem
 *
 *  The L_thread subsystem provides a simple cooperative scheduler to
 *  enable arbitrary functions to run as cooperative threads within a
 * single P-thread.
 *
 * The subsystem provides a P-thread like API that is intended to assist in
 * reuse of legacy code written for POSIX p_threads.
 *
 * The L-thread subsystem relies on cooperative multitasking, as such
 * an L-thread must possess frequent rescheduling points. Often these
 * rescheduling points are provided transparently when the application
 * invokes an L-thread API.
 *
 * In some applications it is possible that the program may enter a loop the
 * exit condition for which depends on the action of another thread or a
 * response from hardware. In such a case it is necessary to yield the thread
 * periodically in the loop body, to allow other threads an opportunity to
 * run. This can be done by inserting a call to lthread_yield() or
 * lthread_sleep(n) in the body of the loop.
 *
 * If the application makes expensive / blocking system calls or does other
 * work that would take an inordinate amount of time to complete, this will
 * stall the cooperative scheduler resulting in very poor performance.
 *
 * In such cases an L-thread can be migrated temporarily to another scheduler
 * running in a different P-thread on another core. When the expensive or
 * blocking operation is completed it can be migrated back to the original
 * scheduler.  In this way other threads can continue to run on the original
 * scheduler and will be completely unaffected by the blocking behaviour.
 * To migrate an L-thread to another scheduler the API lthread_set_affinity()
 * is provided.
 *
 * If L-threads that share data are running on the same core it is possible
 * to design programs where mutual exclusion mechanisms to protect shared data
 * can be avoided. This is due to the fact that the cooperative threads cannot
 * preempt each other.
 *
 * There are two cases where mutual exclusion mechanisms are necessary.
 *
 *  a) Where the L-threads sharing data are running on different cores.
 *  b) Where code must yield while updating data shared with another thread.
 *
 * The L-thread subsystem provides a set of mutex APIs to help with such
 * scenarios, however excessive reliance on on these will impact performance
 * and is best avoided if possible.
 *
 * L-threads can synchronise using a fast condition variable implementation
 * that supports signal and broadcast. An L-thread running on any core can
 * wait on a condition.
 *
 * L-threads can have L-thread local storage with an API modelled on either the
 * P-thread get/set specific API or using PER_LTHREAD macros modelled on the
 * RTE_PER_LCORE macros. Alternatively a simple user data pointer may be set
 * and retrieved from a thread.

 * lthread is created and a pointer to this memory is stored in the lthread.
 * The per lthread variables are accessed via the pointer + the offset of the
 * particular variable.
 *
 * The total size of per lthread storage, and the variable offsets are found by
 * defining the variables in a unique global memory section, the start and end
 * of which is known. This global memory section is used only in the

 *
 * Due to the fact that variables declared this way may be scattered across
 * many files, the start and end of the section and variable offsets are only
 * known after linking, thus the computation of section size and variable
 * addresses is performed at run time.
 *
 * These macros are primarily provided to aid porting of code that makes use
 * of the existing RTE_PER_LCORE macros. In principle it would be more efficient
 * to gather all lthread local variables into a single structure and

 * If you define storage using these macros then the lthread_data_set/get APIs
 * will not perform as expected, the lthread_data_set API does nothing, and the
