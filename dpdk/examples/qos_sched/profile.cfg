; This file enables the following hierarchical scheduler configuration for each
; 10GbE output port:
;	* Single subport (subport 0):
;		- Subport rate set to 100% of port rate
;		- Each of the 13 traffic classes has rate set to 100% of port rate
;	* 4K pipes per subport 0 (pipes 0 .. 4095) with identical configuration:
;		- Pipe rate set to 1/4K of port rate
;		- Each of the 13 traffic classes has rate set to 100% of pipe rate
;		- Within lowest priority traffic class (best-effort), the byte-level
;		  WRR weights for the 4 queues of best effort traffic class are set
;		  to 1:1:1:1
;
