/*
 * rwlock test
 * ===========
 *
 * - There is a global rwlock and a table of rwlocks (one per lcore).
 *
 * - The test function takes all of these locks and launches the
 *   ``test_rwlock_per_core()`` function on each core (except the master).
 *
 *   - The function takes the global write lock, display something,
 *     then releases the global lock.
 *   - Then, it takes the per-lcore write lock, display something, and
 *     releases the per-core lock.
 *   - Finally, a read lock is taken during 100 ms, then released.
 *
 * - The main function unlocks the per-lcore locks sequentially and
 *   waits between each lock. This triggers the display of a message
 *   for each core, in the correct order.
 *
 *   Then, it tries to take the global write lock and display the last
 *   message. The autotest script checks that the message order is correct.
